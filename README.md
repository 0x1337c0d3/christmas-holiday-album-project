# 14-Day Album Project

A comprehensive creative framework for composing a Bowie "Low" / Jarre "Waiting for Cousteau" inspired album in two weeks.

---

## Project Overview

**Concept:** Create a split album with:
- **Side A:** 5-6 song sketches (~3-4 min each, ~20 min total)
- **Side B:** 3-4 ambient movements (~5-7 min each, ~20 min total)

**Duration:** 14 days  
**Approach:** Disciplined creative sprints with intentional constraints  
**Philosophy:** Capture ideas, not perfection — sketches over polish

---

## Structure

## Core Principles

### Creative Constraints

1. **Time Limits:** 1 hour per track (Side A), 1-1.5 hrs per movement (Side B)
2. **Instrument Limits:** Max 2 synths + drums per Side A track
3. **Fixed Palette:** Choose sounds once, stick to them
4. **No Revisiting:** Don't return to previous days' work until Lock-In
5. **Sketches, Not Productions:** Capture ideas, resist perfecting

### Why Constraints Work

- Eliminate decision fatigue
- Force momentum over perfection
- Create cohesive sonic identity
- Prevent analysis paralysis
- Honor the Bowie/Eno Berlin Trilogy aesthetic

---

## Sound Palette

### Hardware Synths
- **Sequential Prophet 12** — pads, chords, drones
- **Nord Lead 2X** — leads, motifs, arpeggios
- **Roland VSynth XT** — textures, drums (sampled), time-stretch
- **Yamaha FS1R** — formant pads (Side B primary)
- **Moog Little Phatty** — all bass
- **Dave Smith Evolver** — textures, modulation
- **Korg Volca Beats** — percussion (sampled)

### Organic Instruments
- **Fender Telecaster** — clean arpeggios, volume swells
- **Upright Piano** — felted, sparse

### DAW & Processing
- **Ableton Live**
- **Drums:** Sampled into Drum Rack for consistency
- **Reverb:** Short plate (Side A), long hall (Side B)
- **Effects:** Tape saturation, gentle compression

## Tonal Architecture

### Side A Key Plan
1. **Track 1:** A Mixolydian (A9 → Bbmaj7 → Gm9 → Cmaj9 → Fmaj9)
2. **Track 2:** C minor (Cm → Eb → Gm → F)
3. **Track 3:** Cm → Gb → F → Abm (collage)
4. **Track 4:** Bb major → D → Dmaj7
5. **Track 5:** Em → Am → F#m → F

**Arc:** Bright/angular → dark/groovy → experimental → catchy → calm

### Side B Modal Plan
1. **Movement I:** C# Dorian (stillness)
2. **Movement II:** E Mixolydian (gentle motion)
3. **Movement III:** B Aeolian (dark contemplation)
4. **Movement IV:** C Lydian (bright resolution) — OPTIONAL

**Arc:** Neutral → bright → dark → light (or end in darkness)

---

## Cohesion Elements

- **Melodic:** Track 1 motif recurs in Track 5 and Movement III
- **Textural:** Evolver patch across multiple Side A tracks
- **Sonic:** FS1R previewed in Track 5, central to Side B
- **Structural:** Side A "songs" contrast with Side B "suite"

## How to Use This Documentation

### If Starting from Scratch:

1. **Read [Day 01 Cheat Card](docs/Album%20Project/Cheat%20Cards/Day%2001%20-%20Concept%20and%20Sound%20Palette.md)**
2. **Set up your sound palette** (see [Resources/Consolidated Palette](docs/Album%20Project/Resources/Consolidated%20Palette.md))
3. **Follow one Cheat Card per day** in order
4. **Reference Resources as needed** (Oblique Strategies, Motif Generator, etc.)
5. **Stay disciplined** with time limits
6. **Complete Day 14** and step away

### If Adapting for Your Own Project:

- Use the daily structure as a framework
- Substitute your own instruments/sound palette
- Adjust the Side A/Side B concept to your needs
- Keep the core principle: **constraints + momentum = creativity**

## Expected Outcomes

By Day 14, you will have:

✅ **5-6 Side A track sketches** (~18-22 min)  
✅ **3-4 Side B ambient movements** (~18-22 min)  
✅ **~40 minutes of original music**  
✅ **Cohesive album structure**  
✅ **Rough mixes exported**  
✅ **Optional: Stems for future mixing**  
✅ **Complete documentation**

**What it is NOT:**
- Final mixes
- Mastered tracks
- Polished productions

**What it IS:**
- Complete musical ideas
- Album-ready sketches
- Foundation for future work (or finished artistic statement)

---

## Philosophy

This project embraces the aesthetic of:

- **David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy** (Low, Heroes, Lodger)
- **Brian Eno's ambient works** (Music for Airports, Apollo, Thursday Afternoon)
- **Jean Michel Jarre's long-form compositions** (Waiting for Cousteau, Oxygène)

**Key insight:** Some of the best albums were made quickly, with constraints, embracing imperfection. "Low" was recorded in weeks. Eno's ambient works often celebrate the unfinished quality.

**Your sketches have value as sketches.** They don't need to be "finished" to be artistically complete.

---

## After Day 14

### Option 1: It's Done
- Treat the rough sketches as the final album
- Embrace the unpolished Bowie/Eno aesthetic
- Archive and move to next project

### Option 2: Future Polish
- Take 2-4 weeks away (minimum)
- Return with fresh ears
- Mixing pass (optional)
- Mastering (optional)

### Option 3: Dual Release
- Keep sketches as "demo" version
- Create polished version later
- Both have artistic merit

**There is no wrong answer.**
