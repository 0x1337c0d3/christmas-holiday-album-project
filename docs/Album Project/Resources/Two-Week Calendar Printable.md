**Time Budget:** 2-3 hours

**Tasks:**
- ✅ Choose running order (play all 5 tracks, decide sequence)

---

### **DAY 9 — Tuesday: Movement II (E Mixolydian, 6:00)**

**Objective:** Brightest movement (emotional peak)  
**Time Budget:** 1.5-2 hours

**Tasks:**

- ✅ Automate reduction (7:00-8:00 — fade to B drone alone, then silence)

**Export:** Rough mix (Mov03_Rough_Day10.wav)  
**Mindset:** "Let it dissolve. Silence is composition."

---

### **DAY 11 — Thursday: Movement IV (Optional, 3-5:00)**

**Objective:** Optional transition/coda  
**Time Budget:** 1 hour (or skip if you prefer 3 movements)

**Tasks:**
- ✅ Record textural collage (guitar feedback, piano prep, field recordings)
- ✅ No drone (breaks pattern, creates sense of freefall)
- ✅ No fixed tonal center (ambiguous, abstract)
- ✅ Automate fade (all elements drop out one by one)
- ✅ End in silence (album ends)

**Export:** Rough mix (Mov04_Rough_Day11.wav) OR skip this day  
**Mindset:** "This is optional. Trust your instinct."

---

**Objective:** Finalize Side B structure  
**Time Budget:** 2-3 hours

**Tasks:**
- ✅ Arrange all movements in order (Movement I → II → III → IV)

- ✅ Add transitions (crossfades between movements, 10-15 seconds)
- ✅ Balance levels (gentle, no compression, preserve dynamics)
- ✅ Export stems (all movements, all layers)
- ✅ Export Side B rough mix (SideB_Rough_Day12.wav)
- ✅ Listen through once (no editing, just listen)

**Export:** Side B rough mix + all stems  
**Mindset:** "Side B is done. Both sides exist."

---

### **DAY 13 — Saturday: Cohesion Day**

**Objective:** Create unity between Side A and Side B  
**Time Budget:** 2-3 hours

**Tasks:**
- ✅ Reuse 1-2 motifs from Side A in Side B (as textures, not melodies)
- ✅ Check tonal arc (A Mixolydian → E minor [Side A] → C# Dorian → Bb Phrygian [Side B])
- ✅ Rough volume balance (Side A and Side B should feel like one album)
- ✅ Add small connective elements (optional: 5-10 seconds of ambient drone between sides)
- ✅ Export full album rough mix (Album_Rough_Day13.wav)
- ✅ Listen through entire album once (45+ minutes, no stops)

**Export:** Full album rough mix  
**Mindset:** "This is an album, not two separate projects."

---

### **DAY 14 — Sunday: Album Render & Wrap**

**Objective:** Finalize and celebrate  
**Time Budget:** 2-3 hours (then REST)

**Tasks:**
- ✅ Export final album rough mix (Album_Rough_Day14.wav)

- ✅ Export final stems (organized by track/movement)
- ✅ Backup entire project (external drive or cloud)

## Daily Rituals (Recommended)

### Before Each Creative Day:

1. **Morning:**
   - Review Cheat Card for that day
   - Set 1-hour timer (or 1.5-2 hours for ambient days)
   - No email, no social media until timer is up

2. **During Session:**
   - Start recording within 5 minutes (no overthinking)
   - Trust first instincts
   - Don't stop to "fix" — keep forward momentum
   - If stuck, consult Oblique Strategies resource

3. **After Session:**
   - Export rough mix immediately
   - No re-listening (save for next day)
   - Cross off day on printed calendar
   - Rest

---

## Week-by-Week Goals

### Week 1 Goal:
> "By Sunday night, I have 5 complete song sketches and a Side A rough mix."

### Week 2 Goal:
> "By Sunday night, I have a complete 45-minute album rough mix with track names."

---

## Emergency Strategies

### If You Fall Behind:

- **Skip Movement IV** (Day 11) — 3 movements is enough for Side B
- **Shorten tracks** — Track 5 can be 2:00 instead of 2:30
- **Reduce layers** — 3-4 layers per track is plenty
- **Trust sketches** — Don't re-do, move forward

### If You Get Stuck:

- **Use Oblique Strategies** (random creative prompts)
- **Use Motif Generator** (instant melodic ideas)
- **Simplify** — Fewer elements, more space
- **Take a 15-minute walk** — Return with fresh ears

---

## What Success Looks Like

By Day 14, you will have:

- ✅ 5-6 songs (Side A, ~18-22 minutes)
- ✅ 3-4 ambient movements (Side B, ~20-25 minutes)
- ✅ Full album rough mix (~45 minutes)
- ✅ All stems exported (for future mixing)
- ✅ Track names finalized
- ✅ Complete creative satisfaction

**This is not a demo. This is an album.**
