Complete creative direction for all tracks and movements.

## SIDE A — TRACK BRIEFS

### Track 1 — "Opening Fragment"

**Duration:** ~3 min  
**Key:** A Mixolydian / A Major-ish with colour tones  
**Progression:** A9 → Bbmaj7 → Gm9 → Cmaj9 → Fmaj9  
**Vibe:** Angular, unexpected, confident start

**Elements:**
- Nord Lead 2X motif — bright, punchy digital tone
- Prophet 12 chords — glassy modulated chords
- Moog Little Phatty bass — mono, simple, detuned
- Evolver bleeps — unpredictable movement, Bowie-era weirdness

**Process:**
- Keep it jumpy; abrupt changes are a feature, not a bug
- This establishes the album's sonic world
- Main motif will recur in Track 5 and Side B Movement III

---

### Track 2 — "Shadow Pop"

**Duration:** 3–4 min  
**Key:** C minor → Eb major → Gm → F  
**Progression:** Cm → Eb → Gm → F  
**Vibe:** Mood lift/shift after bold opening. Darker colour, more rhythmic

**Elements:**
- Nord Lead 2X — simple 5-note repeating riff
- Prophet 12 — darker pads, sustained and overlapping
- Moog bass — more driving than Track 1
- Drums — loose beat, more prominent

**Process:**
- Loose drum machine beat drives the track
- Let the last 20 seconds fall apart into ambience
- This hints at Side B's textural world

---

### Track 3 — "Blue Glass"

**Duration:** 2–3 min  
**Key:** C minor → G minor → Ab minor (pivot)  
**Progression:** Cm → Gb → F → Abm  
**Vibe:** Tense collage; Eno-like tape-loop energy. Abrupt edits allowed

**Elements:**
- VSynth XT artifacts — time-stretched, granular, formant-evolving (the star)
- Prophet 12 chords — static, held, minimal movement
- Nord Lead (optional/minimal) — small melodic fragments as punctuation
- Drums (minimal) — consider using NO traditional drums

**Process:**
- Structure: almost collage-like
- Each chord change can arrive with a texture shift instead of drums
- Think 3-4 distinct sections with hard edits between
- Bowie's "Art Decade" or Eno's "1/1" vibe

---

### Track 4 — "Dislocation"

**Duration:** ~3 min  
**Key:** Bb major → D minor → D → Dmaj7  
**Progression:** Bbmaj7 → Dm → D → Dmaj7 → Bb → A  
**Vibe:** Feels like Low side A: short, catchy, harmonic sleight-of-hand. "Closest thing to a single"

**Elements:**
- Nord Lead 2X — main melodic hook (8-12 notes, hummable)
- Prophet 12 chords — supportive, quick changes
- Moog bass — clear, present, slightly melodic
- Drums — full kit, consistent throughout

**Process:**
- Feel: The most "song-like" track
- Add one melodic hook that's hummable
- Keep structure simple: A / B / A
- The D → Dmaj7 shift is the "magic moment"

---

### Track 5 — "Small Resolution"

**Duration:** 2:30  
**Key:** Em → Am → F#m → F  
**Progression:** C → Em7 → Am7 → F#m7 → F  
**Vibe:** Soft landing before ambient world arrives. Short, punchy, motif-driven

**Elements:**
- Telecaster guitar OR Upright piano (organic focus)
- Prophet 12 chords — soft, supportive pads
- Nord Lead (minimal) — brings back Track 1 motif (transformed, quieter)
- Moog bass (minimal or none)
- Drums (optional/minimal or none)

**Process:**
- Minimal drums or none
- Use clean Telecaster arpeggios OR felted piano
- **Reuse Track 1 motif for unity** (album cohesion)
- Fade it into a drone to lead into Side B
- Keep it SHORT (2:30 max)

## SIDE B — AMBIENT SUITE BRIEFS

### Movement I — "Arrival in Stillness"

**Duration:** 5-7 min  
**Mode:** C# Dorian  
**Drone root:** C#  
**Vibe:** "Settling in" moment — neither sad nor bright

**Elements:**
- FS1R — formant-rich evolving pad (main voice)
- Prophet 12 — sub drone, very low
- VSynth XT (optional) — granular texture, background
- Field ambience (optional) — room tone, mechanical hum

**Process:**
- Static for 2-3 minutes before any real movement
- Around 2:00: Introduce D# (9th)
- Around 3:30: Add A# (6th) for color
- Let it breathe — nothing significant happens in first 2 minutes
- Pure stillness establishes Side B aesthetic

---

### Movement II — "Soft Machinery"

**Duration:** 5-7 min  
**Mode:** E Mixolydian  
**Drone root:** E  
**Vibe:** Keeps some brightness but still ambiguous; gentle pulses

**Elements:**
- FS1R — formant pad on E Mixolydian
- Prophet 12 — E drone
- Gentle pulses — Nord/VSynth (NOT drums, filtered synth pulses)
- VSynth XT — time-stretched piano or granular vocal
- Piano (optional) — single notes, 15-20 seconds apart

**Process:**
- Glide from C# Dorian by introducing G# (common tone)
- Add gentle rhythmic pulses (but not drums)
- Slow polyrhythmic arpeggio or filtered patterns
- Creates motion without obvious tempo
- Gradual build, but never peaks

---

### Movement III — "Night Structures"

**Duration:** 5-7 min  
**Mode:** B Aeolian  
**Drone root:** B  
**Vibe:** Calm, darker space without being melodramatic

**Elements:**
- FS1R — darker formant character
- Prophet 12 — B drone
- Telecaster OR Piano — ghost notes, very sparse (E-bow swells or single notes)
- VSynth XT/Evolver — darker, shadowy textures
- **Optional: Track 1 motif callback** — appears ONCE, very quietly, around 4-minute mark

**Process:**
- E Mixolydian shares A and B — crossfade pads on common tones
- Introduce Telecaster/Piano ghost notes (sparse, 20-30 sec apart)
- Dark but calm atmosphere (not oppressive)
- Optional motif callback creates album-wide cohesion

---

### Movement IV — "Dissolve" (OPTIONAL)

**Duration:** 2-4 min  
**Mode:** C Lydian  
**Drone root:** C  
**Vibe:** Ethereal, otherworldly, "rising into light"

**Elements:**
- Prophet 12 — single evolving C Lydian chord
- FS1R (optional) — bright pad emphasizing F# (Lydian #11)
- Telecaster (optional) — volume swells on C, maybe F#
- Field recording (optional) — gentle wind, room fade

**Process:**
- Move from B Aeolian by raising B to C and introducing F♯
- Brief (2-4 min max) epilogue
- Should feel like it's dissolving from the moment it begins
- Everything gradually fades to silence over final 60-90 seconds
- End in complete silence

**Note:** Movement IV is optional. Many great ambient suites are 3 movements. Decide based on whether Movement III feels like a strong ending.

## Cross-Album Elements

### Recurring Motifs:
- Track 1 motif appears in Track 5 (transformed, quieter)
- Track 1 motif appears in Movement III (very quiet, around 4:00 mark)
- Creates subliminal album cohesion

### Textural Threads:
- Evolver patch across Side A tracks (1, 3, 4)
- VSynth XT granular textures in Track 3 and Side B movements
- FS1R hinted in Track 5, central to all Side B

### Tonal Arc:
**Side A:** A Mix → C min → Cm/Abm → Bb/Dmaj → Em  
**Side B:** C# Dorian → E Mix → B Aeolian → C Lydian

This creates a natural journey from bright/angular through darkness to resolution/light.
