# Consolidated Palette

Complete sound specifications for Side A and Side B.

---

## Philosophy

This is your **fixed palette** for the entire 14-day project.

**Rule:** You may only use these instruments and sounds. No adding new synths, no downloading new samples, no "just one more reverb plugin."

The constraints are intentional — they force creativity and ensure cohesion.

---

## Hardware Synths

### Sequential Prophet 12

**Primary Use:** Pads, chords, sub-bass drones (Side B), occasional leads

**Core Patches to Build:**

1. **"Warm Pad"** — 4 oscillators, sawtooth + triangle, slight detune (±5 cents), slow filter LFO, long attack/release
2. **"Dark Pad"** — 4 oscillators, pulse waves, more detune (±10 cents), lowpass filter with resonance, tape saturation
3. **"Sub-Bass Drone"** — 2 oscillators, sawtooth + sine, -2 octaves, no attack/release, filter at 150 Hz
4. **"Shimmer Pad"** — 4 oscillators, triangle waves, high register, long reverb send, subtle chorus
5. **"Lead 1"** — Single oscillator, sawtooth, filter envelope modulation, moderate attack

**Processing:**
- Always: Lowpass or highpass filter (rarely wide open)
- Reverb: Plate (Side A), Long Hall (Side B)
- Subtle chorus or ensemble (for width)

**Why Prophet 12:**
Polyphonic, stable tuning, flexible architecture. The 4 oscillators per voice create thick, evolving textures without external layering.

### Nord Lead 2X

**Primary Use:** Melodic leads, arpeggios, stabbing chords (Side A), mid-range drones (Side B)

**Core Patches to Build:**

1. **"Berlin Lead"** — Sawtooth, highpass filter, slight portamento, moderate attack, bright and cutting
2. **"Arpeggio"** — Square wave, fast filter envelope, short decay, staccato feel
3. **"Soft Lead"** — Sine + triangle, slow attack, long release, filtered (warm, Jarre-like)
4. **"Drone Layer"** — Two oscillators (root + 5th), detuned ±5 cents, no modulation, infinite sustain
5. **"Chord Stabs"** — Sawtooth + pulse, fast attack, short decay, highpass filter (punchy)

**Processing:**
- Reverb: Plate (Side A), Long Hall (Side B)
- Delay: Quarter-note dotted delay (Side A only, sparingly)
- No heavy distortion (keep it clean)

**Why Nord Lead 2X:**
Virtual analog, bright character, excellent for melodic content. The filters are musical and never harsh.

---

### Roland VSynth XT

**Primary Use:** Experimental textures, granular effects, drum samples (Day 1 sampling source)

**Core Patches to Build:**

1. **"Granular Texture"** — Time Trip pad, long grain size, random pitch variation, reverb
2. **"Metallic Shimmer"** — Analog oscillator + COSM processing (Vocal/Choir setting), high resonance
3. **"Drum Sample Base"** — Sine wave + noise, tuned for kick, snare, hat (see "VSynth XT Drum Kit Build" resource)
4. **"Drone Texture"** — Oscillator sync, slow LFO on sync point, filtered harmonics
5. **"Weird Lead"** — Time Trip solo voice, moderate grain size, pitch envelope

**Processing:**
- Built-in COSM effects (vocal processing, ring mod)
- External: Long reverb, tape saturation
- Use for "alien" sounds in Side B Movement III

**Why VSynth XT:**
Hybrid analog/digital. The Time Trip engine creates textures impossible on other synths. Perfect for Eno-style strangeness.

---

### Yamaha FS1R

**Primary Use:** Inharmonic pads, FM bells, metallic textures (Side B), occasional vocal-like tones

**Core Patches to Build:**

1. **"FM Bell"** — High modulation index, fast decay, tuned to key
2. **"Formant Pad"** — Voiced operators (vowel-like), slow attack/release, layered formants
3. **"Metallic Drone"** — Inharmonic operators, infinite sustain, slow filter modulation
4. **"Shimmer Texture"** — High-register formants, detuned, reverb-heavy
5. **"Dark FM Pad"** — Low modulation index, filtered, long release

**Processing:**
- Reverb: Long Hall (always)
- Chorus (subtle, for width)
- EQ to reduce harsh high frequencies

**Why FS1R:**
The only FM synth in the palette. Its formant synthesis creates vocal/alien textures that contrast with the analog warmth of Prophet and Nord.

---

### Moog Little Phatty

**Primary Use:** Bass (Side A), sub-bass drones (Side B), occasional lead

**Core Patches to Build:**

1. **"Sub-Bass"** — Sawtooth + square (octave down), lowpass filter at ~200 Hz, no release
2. **"Bass Lead"** — Sawtooth, filter envelope modulation, moderate resonance, short decay
3. **"Bass Drone"** — Single oscillator (sawtooth), filter wide open, infinite sustain
4. **"Moog Lead"** — Sawtooth, highpass filter, moderate resonance, glide on
5. **"Thick Bass"** — Square wave, filter at ~300 Hz, slight resonance

**Processing:**
- Tape saturation (always, for warmth)
- Plate reverb (Side A, minimal)
- EQ to tame low-end rumble (<40 Hz)

**Why Moog Little Phatty:**
Monophonic, pure analog, the definitive Moog bass sound. The filter is iconic. Use it for foundational low-end.

---

### Dave Smith Evolver

**Primary Use:** Complex rhythmic parts, dark pads, external processing (guitar, piano), noise/feedback

**Core Patches to Build:**

1. **"Dark Pad"** — Analog + digital wavetable oscillators, feedback, long attack/release
2. **"Rhythmic Texture"** — Sequencer modulating filter and pitch, no external MIDI
3. **"Noise Texture"** — Noise oscillator, filtered, slow modulation, reverb
4. **"External Processing"** — Passthrough mode, filter + feedback applied to guitar/piano input
5. **"Glitch Lead"** — Digital wavetable, fast LFO modulation, quantized pitch

**Processing:**
- Reverb: Long Hall
- Distortion (built-in feedback path)
- Use sparingly (most "experimental" synth in palette)

**Why Evolver:**
Hybrid architecture, feedback path, external input. It's the "weird" synth. Use it for textures that don't fit anywhere else.

---

### Korg Volca Beats

**Primary Use:** Supplemental drum sounds (after Day 1 sampling), lo-fi percussion textures

**Sounds Available:**
- Kick, Snare, Lo Tom, Hi Tom
- Closed Hat, Open Hat
- Clap
- Claves, Agogo
- Crash

**Processing:**
- Use raw (no effects) for lo-fi quality
- Layer sparingly with Drum Rack samples
- Tape saturation if needed

**Why Volca Beats:**
Analog drum sounds, immediate, lo-fi character. Adds grit to overly polished Drum Rack samples.

---

## Acoustic Instruments

### Fender Telecaster (Electric Guitar)

**Primary Use:** Ambient swells (Side B), textural layers (Side A), feedback drones

**Techniques:**
- Volume swells (guitar volume knob)
- EBow for infinite sustain
- Feedback (controlled, in front of amp)
- Clean tone (no distortion, reverb only)
- Slide guitar (occasional)

**Processing:**
- Apogee Ensemble input (clean, high-quality)
- Long reverb (8+ seconds)
- Delay (dotted quarter, Side A only)
- Tape saturation (subtle)

**Why Guitar:**
Adds organic, human quality. The Telecaster's bright tone contrasts with synth darkness.

---

### Upright Piano

**Primary Use:** Melodic arpeggios (Side A), chord clusters (Side B Movement II), prepared piano textures

**Techniques:**
- Standard playing (melodic, chordal)
- Prepared piano (objects on strings)
- Inside piano (plucked/bowed strings)
- Sustain pedal (ambient washes)

**Recording:**
- Room mics (stereo pair, natural reverb)
- Close mic (detail, attack)
- Blend both (60% room, 40% close)

**Processing:**
- Minimal (piano has natural reverb from room)
- Plate reverb (Side A, subtle)
- EQ to reduce rumble (<80 Hz)

**Why Piano:**
Acoustic contrast to synths. The upright's imperfections (slightly out-of-tune, mechanical noise) add character.

---

## Ableton Drum Rack

**Primary Source:** Day 1 sampling from VSynth XT (and other hardware)

**Pad Layout:** See "Drum Rack Layout.md" resource for detailed pad-by-pad guide

**Sounds to Sample:**

1. **Kicks** (4 variations) — different tunings, different timbres
2. **Snares** (4 variations) — tight, loose, rim, processed
3. **Hats** (closed, open, shaker-like)
4. **Percussion** (clap, click, wood, metal)
5. **Toms** (low, mid, high)
6. **Cymbals** (crash, ride, splash)
7. **FX** (noise, reverse, granular)

**Processing (per pad):**
- Ableton Simpler (one-shot mode)
- EQ (shape each sound)
- Compression (glue, not heavy)
- Reverb send (tape saturation → plate reverb)

**Why Sample Your Own:**
Ensures unique palette. No one else has these exact sounds. Creates cohesion (all drums from same source).

---

## Sounds You Are NOT Using

To maintain focus, explicitly avoid:

- ❌ Additional soft synths (no Serum, Massive, etc.)
- ❌ Sample libraries (no Splice, no Kontakt libraries)
- ❌ Additional drum machines (Volca Beats is the only one)
- ❌ Modular synths (stick to what you have)
- ❌ Additional plugins (Ableton stock only, except convolution reverb if needed)

**Exception:** Field recordings (room ambience, found sounds) are allowed, but only for Side B Movement IV (optional).

---

## Audio Routing

### Synth → Apogee Ensemble → Ableton:

- **Prophet 12:** Stereo out → Apogee Inputs 1-2
- **Nord Lead 2X:** Stereo out → Apogee Inputs 3-4
- **Moog Little Phatty:** Mono out → Apogee Input 5 (duplicate to stereo in Ableton)
- **VSynth XT:** Stereo out → Apogee Inputs 6-7
- **FS1R:** Stereo out → Apogee Inputs 8-9 (via ADAT)
- **Evolver:** Stereo out → Apogee Inputs 10-11 (via ADAT)
- **Guitar:** Mono → Apogee Input 12 (via ADAT)

**Apogee Ensemble → RME BabyFace (ADAT):** Ensure ADAT connection is stable for FS1R, Evolver, Guitar inputs.

---

## Naming Convention for Patches

Use consistent naming across all synths:

**Format:** `[SYNTH]_[TYPE]_[NAME]`

**Examples:**
- `PROPH12_PAD_WarmStrings`
- `NORD_LEAD_BerlinMelody`
- `MOOG_BASS_SubDeep`
- `VSYNTH_TEXTURE_Granular01`
- `FS1R_PAD_FormantDrone`

Store these in each synth's memory and also document in a text file (for recall).

---

## Palette Lock-In Checklist

Before starting Day 2, verify:

- ✅ All synth patches built and saved
- ✅ Drum Rack populated with Day 1 samples
- ✅ Reverb templates created as audio tracks
- ✅ Processing chains saved as Ableton Racks
- ✅ No additional instruments or plugins in project
- ✅ Audio routing tested and stable

**If anything is missing, build it on Day 1. Do NOT add new sounds after Day 1.**

---

## Why This Palette Works

1. **Variety** — Analog, digital, FM, acoustic
2. **Cohesion** — All sounds pass through same reverbs and processing
3. **Constraints** — Forces creativity, prevents decision paralysis
4. **Bowie/Eno Aesthetic** — Blend of hi-fi (Prophet, Nord) and lo-fi (Volca, prepared piano)
5. **Practical** — Everything you own, no need to buy/download anything
