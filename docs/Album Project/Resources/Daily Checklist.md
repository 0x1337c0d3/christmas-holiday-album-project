# Daily Checklist

Printable checklist for each day's creative session.

---

## General Daily Workflow (Side A)

- [ ] Pick tempo + key (2 min)
- [ ] Choose *two* synths max for today (constraint = creativity)
- [ ] Create one motif (melody or rhythmic idea)
- [ ] Build a harmonic bed (pads or chords)
- [ ] Add one texture layer (noise, piano, guitar, sample)
- [ ] Add bass line
- [ ] Add drums (from your pre-built Drum Rack)
- [ ] Bounce a rough 2–3 min sketch
- [ ] Label it clearly (YYYY-MM-DD_TrackName)
- [ ] Optional: Export stems if useful
- [ ] Back up the project
- [ ] **Stop — no perfection; move on**

**Time Budget:** 1 hour maximum per track

---

## General Daily Workflow (Side B)

- [ ] Set up drone (Prophet 12, very low)
- [ ] Create main pad (FS1R formant synthesis)
- [ ] Let it establish for 60-120 seconds (patience!)
- [ ] Around 2-3 min mark: Add one new element (texture, color note, or pulse)
- [ ] Optional: Add sparse melodic hints (guitar/piano ghost notes)
- [ ] Let full session play 5-7 minutes
- [ ] Ensure evolution is SLOW (nothing dramatic)
- [ ] Bounce rough mix
- [ ] Label clearly
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] **Stop — resist adding more layers**

**Time Budget:** 1-1.5 hours per movement

---

## Creative Philosophy Reminders

### Side A:
- **Two synths max per session** — prevents paralysis
- **Abrupt changes are features** — Bowie/Eno aesthetic
- **1-hour limit enforces momentum** — creative flash, not perfection
- **No revisiting yesterday's track** — kills momentum

### Side B:
- **Nothing significant should happen in the first 2 minutes** — Eno's approach
- **Texture IS the event** — subtle changes are the content
- **Resist filling space** — emptiness is intentional
- **Patience over momentum** — different from Side A

---

## Daily Approach Rotation (Side A)

Keep each day's approach fresh by alternating:

- **Day 2:** Start with chords/harmony
- **Day 3:** Start with rhythm/drums
- **Day 4:** Start with chords/harmony
- **Day 5:** Start with rhythm/drums
- **Day 6:** Start with organic instrument (guitar/piano)

---

## Export Standards

### File Naming:
```
A01_TrackName_2025-12-XX.wav  (Side A tracks)
B01_MovementName_2025-12-XX.wav  (Side B movements)
```

### Format:
- WAV, 24-bit
- 44.1 or 48 kHz
- Stereo

### Optional Stems:
```
TrackName/
  ├── Drums.wav
  ├── Bass.wav
  ├── Chords.wav
  ├── Lead.wav
  ├── Texture.wav
  └── MIX.wav
```

## Backup Checklist

After each session:

- [ ] Save Ableton project with clear name
- [ ] Export rough mix
- [ ] Optional: Export stems
- [ ] Copy to external hard drive
- [ ] Copy to cloud storage (Dropbox, etc.)
- [ ] Verify files aren't corrupted

**Don't skip this** — 2 weeks of work deserves 3 backup locations.

- [ ] Light level balancing
- [ ] Optional: light automation (filter, reverb, volume)
- [ ] Export rough mixes (individual tracks)
- [ ] Export full Side A assembly
- [ ] Back up everything

### Day 12 (Side B Lock-In):

---

## Cohesion Day Checklist (Day 13)

- [ ] Finalize all track/movement titles
- [ ] Render final rough mixes (individual tracks)
- [ ] Render full album assembly
- [ ] Create production notes document
- [ ] Write reflection journal entry
- [ ] Optional: Create liner notes
- [ ] Optional: Album artwork mockup
- [ ] Back up all files (3 locations)

## Emergency Troubleshooting

**If you're stuck on a track:**
1. Use an Oblique Strategy (see [Oblique Strategies](Oblique%20Strategies.md))
2. Use the Motif Generator (see [Motif Generator](Motif%20Generator.md))
3. Take a 10-minute walk
4. Switch to a different track
5. Remember: Good enough is good enough

**If you're running over time:**
1. Set a hard timer for 60 minutes
2. When it goes off, bounce what you have
3. Move on — momentum > perfection

**If you hate what you made:**
1. Bounce it anyway
2. Move on to next day
3. You can delete it during Lock-In if needed
4. Most "bad" sketches reveal their value later

## The Two Most Important Rules

1. **Stop when time is up** — the constraint is what makes this work
2. **Don't revisit finished tracks until Lock-In day** — forward momentum is everything
