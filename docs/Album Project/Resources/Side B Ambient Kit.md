# Side B Ambient Kit

Complete modal and textural guide for the ambient suite.

---

## Overview

Side B is a 3-4 movement ambient suite inspired by Eno's "Apollo" and Jarre's "Waiting for Cousteau."

**Core Approach:**
- Modal (not chord-based)
- Drone-centric
- Texture > melody
- Long sustains, slow evolution
- Space and silence valued

**Total Length:** ~20-25 minutes across 3-4 movements

---

## Movement I — "Arrival" (7:00)

### Mode: C# Dorian

**Scale:** C# - D# - E - F# - G# - A# - B - C#

**Tonal Center:** C# (drone)

**Key Intervals:**
- C# to D# (major 2nd) — openness
- C# to E (minor 3rd) — melancholy
- C# to F# (perfect 4th) — stability
- C# to G# (perfect 5th) — power

**Harmonic Approach:**
- Sustained C# bass drone (never stops)
- Layered 5ths (C#-G#) as foundation
- Add D#, E, F#, G# as color tones in pads
- Avoid A# and B early (save for development)
- No chords — think intervals and clusters

**Why Dorian:**
Dorian has a major 6th (A#), which gives it a slightly brighter quality than natural minor. This prevents the movement from being too dark. The brightness emerges slowly as A# appears later in the movement.

**Texture Layers:**
1. **Sub-bass drone** (C#, constant)
2. **Pad layer 1** (C#-E-G# cluster, slow filter sweep)
3. **Pad layer 2** (D#-F# interval, enters at 2:00)
4. **High shimmer** (C#-E-G# in high register, enters at 4:00)
5. **Prophet 12 lead** (C# pentatonic, sparse notes)

**Development Arc:**
- 0:00-2:00 — C# drone + E note (austere)
- 2:00-4:00 — D# and F# appear (more color)
- 4:00-5:30 — G# and A# enter (brightness increases)
- 5:30-7:00 — Full C# Dorian scale available (climax)

**Processing:**
- Long hall reverb (5-8 second decay)
- Tape saturation on sub-bass
- Slow LFO filter sweeps (1 cycle per 30-60 seconds)
- No compression (preserve dynamics)

**Reference:** Eno's "An Ending (Ascent)" — slow, patient, optimistic

---

## Movement II — "Soft Machinery" (6:00)

### Mode: E Mixolydian

**Scale:** E - F# - G# - A - B - C# - D - E

**Tonal Center:** E (drone)

**Key Intervals:**
- E to D (flattened 7th) — the Mixolydian characteristic
- E to B (perfect 5th) — foundation
- E to G# (major 3rd) — brightness
- E to C# (major 6th) — openness

**Harmonic Approach:**
- Sustained E bass drone (never stops)
- Emphasize the D natural — this is the Mixolydian characteristic note
- Use open 5ths (E-B) as foundation with color tones
- The D natural creates gentle motion without full resolution

**Why Mixolydian:**
Mixolydian is major with a flattened 7th. It sounds bright but slightly ambiguous — perfect for gentle pulses and motion without driving toward resolution. Ideal for the emotional peak of Side B.

**Texture Layers:**
1. **Sub-bass drone** (E, constant)
2. **Pad layer 1** (E-G#-B cluster, bright strings timbre)
3. **Pad layer 2** (D-C# interval, the Mixolydian color)
4. **Piano chords** (E-G#-B-D, slow arpeggios, real piano)
5. **Nord Lead lead** (E Mixolydian, sparse melodic fragments)

**Development Arc:**
- 0:00-1:30 — E drone + B (bare 5th, establish tonal center)
- 1:30-3:00 — G# appears (major tonality confirmed)
- 3:00-4:00 — **D natural enters** (Mixolydian character revealed, emotional shift)
- 4:00-5:00 — Full Mixolydian scale, piano arpeggios (climax)
- 5:00-6:00 — Reduction back to E-B (fade to Movement III)

**Processing:**
- Long hall reverb (8-10 second decay)
- Chorus on piano (subtle width)
- Slow tremolo on pads (0.1 Hz)
- No distortion (keep it clean and bright)

**Reference:** Jarre's "Waiting for Cousteau Part II" — patient, majestic build

---

## Movement III — "Night Structures" (8:00)

### Mode: B Aeolian (Natural Minor)

**Scale:** B - C# - D - E - F# - G - A - B

**Tonal Center:** B (drone)

**Key Intervals:**
- B to D (minor 3rd) — minor tonality
- B to F# (perfect 5th) — foundation
- B to G (minor 6th) — melancholy
- B to A (minor 7th) — suspended quality

**Harmonic Approach:**
- Sustained B bass drone (never stops)
- Use B-D-F# as core minor cluster
- Emphasize G and A for color and motion
- Natural minor creates calm darkness without excessive tension

**Why Aeolian:**
Aeolian (natural minor) is darker than Dorian but less tense than Phrygian. It sounds introspective, calm, and resolved in its darkness. Perfect for the ending of Side B, creating a sense of peaceful dissolution.

**Texture Layers:**
1. **Sub-bass drone** (B, constant)
2. **Pad layer 1** (B-D-F# cluster, dark strings)
3. **Pad layer 2** (G-A interval, adding melancholy color)
4. **FS1R texture** (metallic, inharmonic, enters at 3:00)
5. **Prophet 12 lead** (B Aeolian, extremely sparse)
6. **Telecaster or Piano** (ghost notes, references Side A motif)

**Development Arc:**
- 0:00-2:00 — B drone alone (stark, minimal)
- 2:00-4:00 — D and F# enter (minor tonality established)
- 4:00-6:00 — G and A appear (full darkness, FS1R texture)
- 6:00-7:00 — **Reduction** — back to B-D (dissolving)
- 7:00-8:00 — B drone alone (fade to silence)

**Processing:**
- Long hall reverb (10+ second decay)
- Tape saturation (heavy on FS1R)
- Reverse reverb on final notes
- Slow fade to silence (no hard ending)

**Reference:** Eno's "Deep Blue Day" — dark, introspective, meditative

---

## Optional Movement IV — "Transition / Coda" (3:00-5:00)

If you create a 4th movement, use this as a brief interlude or coda.

### Mode: Open / Ambiguous (No fixed mode)

**Approach:**
- No drone (breaks the pattern)
- Focus on texture and timbre, not harmony
- Field recordings, found sounds, processed guitars
- Can use prepared piano, detuned layers
- Bridges Movement III to silence

**Why No Drone:**
After 20+ minutes of constant drones, removing the drone creates a sense of freefall. The listener is unanchored, which heightens the final resolution (silence).

**Texture Ideas:**
- Guitar feedback (controlled, musical)
- Piano strings (bowed or plucked directly)
- Reversed vocal samples
- Room ambience recordings
- Shortwave radio snippets

**Development Arc:**
- 0:00-1:30 — Texture collage (no pulse, no tonal center)
- 1:30-3:00 — Gradual fade (elements drop out one by one)
- 3:00+ — Silence (album ends)

**Processing:**
- Heavy reverb (everything distant)
- Granular synthesis (time-stretching)
- Randomized panning (spatial movement)

## Drone Techniques

### Synthesizing Drones:

**Prophet 12 (Sub-bass drones):**
- OSC 1: Sawtooth, -2 octaves
- OSC 2: Sine, -2 octaves (slight detune, +3 cents)
- Filter: Lowpass, cutoff at ~150 Hz
- No attack, infinite sustain, no release
- Slight LFO on filter (very slow, barely perceptible)

**Nord Lead 2X (Mid-range drones):**
- OSC 1: Square or pulse wave
- OSC 2: Triangle (detune by 5-8 cents)
- Filter: Lowpass, cutoff at ~800 Hz
- Minimal attack, infinite sustain
- Layer two notes (root + 5th)

**Moog Little Phatty (Bass drones):**
- OSC 1: Sawtooth
- OSC 2: Square (octave down)
- Filter: Lowpass, fully open
- No modulation (pure, stable)
- Single note held (MIDI sustain pedal on)

---

## Pad Techniques

### Synthesizing Pads:

**Sequential Prophet 12 (Evolving pads):**
- Use 4 oscillators, slightly detuned (± 5-10 cents)
- Long attack (2-4 seconds)
- Long release (4-8 seconds)
- LFO modulating filter cutoff (slow, 0.05-0.1 Hz)
- LFO modulating pulse width (slow, 0.03 Hz)
- Layer 3-4 notes (root, 3rd, 5th, 7th)

**Yamaha FS1R (Inharmonic pads):**
- Use FM algorithm with high modulation index
- Detune operators for metallic shimmer
- Long attack and release
- Add formant filter (vowel-like quality)
- Use in Movement III for "alien" texture

**Dave Smith Evolver (Dark pads):**
- Analog OSC + digital wavetable OSC
- Analog filter (lowpass, resonance at 30%)
- Feedback path (adds grit)
- External input for processing (guitar, piano)

## Textural Layering Guide

### Movement I (C# Dorian) — 5 layers maximum:
1. Sub-bass drone (Prophet 12)
2. Mid drone (Nord Lead 2X)
3. High shimmer pad (Prophet 12)
4. Sparse melody (Prophet 12 or Nord)
5. Field recording (optional, late in movement)

### Movement II (Eb Lydian) — 5 layers maximum:
1. Sub-bass drone (Moog Little Phatty)
2. Bright pad (Prophet 12)
3. Lydian color pad (Nord Lead, emphasizing A natural)
4. Real piano arpeggios (recorded)
5. High shimmer (FS1R)

### Movement III (Bb Phrygian) — 4-5 layers maximum:
1. Sub-bass drone (Prophet 12)
2. Dark pad (Evolver)
3. Phrygian color pad (Nord, emphasizing Cb)
4. FS1R metallic texture (mid-movement)
5. Sparse melody (Prophet 12, extremely rare notes)

**Rule:** Never more than 5 simultaneous layers. Ambient music thrives on space.

## Reverb Settings

### For Long Hall Reverb:

**Ableton Reverb Device:**
- **Decay Time:** 8.0-12.0 seconds
- **Pre-Delay:** 40-80 ms (creates space before reverb)
- **Density:** 100% (smooth, no graininess)
- **Size:** 100% (large space)
- **Damping:** Low frequencies 0%, High frequencies 30-50%
- **Dry/Wet:** 60-80% (reverb is prominent)

**Processing Chain:**
Input → EQ (roll off below 100 Hz) → Reverb → Slight Compression (ratio 2:1) → Output

**Why These Settings:**
Long decay creates the sense of infinite space. High wet/dry means the sound is "in" the space, not just colored by it.

---

## Development Techniques

### Textural Evolution:

1. **Addition** — Start minimal, add layers over time
2. **Filtering** — Use slow filter sweeps to reveal/hide frequencies
3. **Spatial Movement** — Pan elements slowly (1% per second)
4. **Dynamic Swells** — Volume automation (crescendo/diminuendo)
5. **Timbral Shifts** — Change oscillator mix over time

### Avoid:

- ❌ Sudden changes (everything is gradual)
- ❌ Percussion (no drums, no pulses)
- ❌ Fast melodies (notes should breathe)
- ❌ Dense chords (intervals and clusters only)
- ❌ Hard endings (always fade)

---

## Practical Modal Usage

### How to Stay in Mode:

1. **Establish the drone** — never stop the bass note
2. **Use scale tones only** — don't chromatic wander
3. **Emphasize characteristic interval** — the one note that defines the mode
4. **Avoid functional harmony** — no chord progressions, just clusters
5. **Think vertically** — intervals stacked, not horizontal melodies

### Example (Movement II, Eb Lydian):

- Drone: Eb (constant)
- Layer 1: Eb + Bb (perfect 5th)
- Layer 2: Eb + G (major 3rd)
- Layer 3: Eb + A (augmented 4th — the Lydian note)
- Layer 4: Eb + D (major 7th — floating quality)

All notes from Eb Lydian scale. No voice leading, no resolution. Just layers accumulating.

## Recording Tips

### For Drone Recordings:

- Record each drone separately (16+ bars minimum)
- Use MIDI sustain pedal for infinite sustain
- Record multiple takes, choose the most stable
- Slight imperfections are OK (human quality)

### For Pad Recordings:

- Long notes (4-8 bars each)
- Overlap notes (legato, no gaps)
- Automate filter cutoff during recording (live performance)
- Layer 3-4 takes of the same part (slight variations)

### For Lead Recordings:

- Extremely sparse (one note every 10-30 seconds)
- No reverb on input (add in mix)
- Let notes fully decay before next note
- Silence is composition

---

## Mix Guidelines

### Level Balancing:

- **Sub-bass drone:** -12 dB (felt, not heard)
- **Mid-range pads:** -6 to -9 dB (prominent but not loud)
- **High shimmer:** -15 dB (barely there, adds air)
- **Lead notes:** -3 dB (clear focal point when present)

### Frequency Ranges:

- **Sub-bass (drone):** 40-80 Hz
- **Bass (drone):** 80-200 Hz
- **Pads:** 200-2000 Hz
- **Shimmer:** 2000-8000 Hz
- **Air:** 8000-15000 Hz

Leave space in each range. Don't crowd.

## Connection to Side A

**Side A ends:** F major (or F drone), Track 5 "Small Resolution"  
**Side B begins:** C# Dorian, Movement I "Arrival"

No direct harmonic relationship (F to C# is an augmented 5th / tritone). The gap is intentional — marks the transition from songs to ambient.

**Optional Bridge:** If you want a subtle connection, you could add a brief (30 second) interlude of ambiguous drones that includes both F and C# before Movement I fully establishes C# Dorian. But the hard cut also works.

---

## Summary

Side B's Ambient Kit provides:
- ✓ 3 distinct modal centers (Dorian, Lydian, Phrygian)
- ✓ Clear drone and pad synthesis techniques
- ✓ Textural layering strategies
- ✓ Emotional arc (arrival → brightness → dissolution)
- ✓ Practical Ableton session structure
- ✓ Mix guidelines for ambient music

**Use this as your foundation, not a formula.** If Movement II wants to be 8 minutes instead of 6, trust your ears. But the modal constraints and textural techniques will keep Side B cohesive and "Eno-like."
