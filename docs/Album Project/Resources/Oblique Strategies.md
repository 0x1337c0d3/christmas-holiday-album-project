# Oblique Strategies

Custom creative prompts for your 14-day album project, inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's original Oblique Strategies.

Use one per session when you're stuck or want a creative jolt. Some are gentle nudges; some are sharp kicks.

## How to Use

### Method 1: Random Selection
- Use a random number generator (1-80)
- Apply that strategy to your current track

### Method 2: Daily Draw
- Pick one strategy at the start of each day
- Let it guide your entire session

### Method 3: When Stuck
- If you hit a creative wall mid-session
- Pull one strategy and apply it immediately
- Don't argue with it — just do it

### Method 4: Intentional Choice
- Read through the list
- Pick the one that makes you most uncomfortable
- That's probably the one you need

## Project-Specific Interpretations

### For Side A (Song Sketches):

**"Replace rhythm with texture" (5):**  
Remove drums entirely from one track, use filtered noise or granular sounds to create pulse instead.

**"Use only sounds from Side B for a Side A track" (18):**  
Build a Side A track using only FS1R formant pads and drones — no traditional leads or rhythms.

**"Let the texture be the melody" (15):**  
Instead of Nord Lead melodic line, make the Evolver modulation patch the main "voice."

### For Side B (Ambient Movements):

**"Double the tempo but halve the density" (13):**  
If using gentle pulses, speed them up but make them quieter and more sparse.

**"Pick one chord and refuse to leave it" (19):**  
Stay on C# for entire Movement I — no other notes, just timbral evolution.

**"Do nothing for as long as possible" (48):**  
Perfect for ambient — resist the urge to add new elements for 3+ minutes.

## Strategy Combinations

Sometimes two strategies together create interesting results:

- **"Freeze a mistake" (4) + "Make it the most important thing" (46)**
- **"Play backwards" (6) + "Remove quantization" (16)**
- **"One finger" (10) + "Finish in 20 minutes" (20)**

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Once you choose a strategy, commit to it** — don't abandon halfway
2. **The strategy might make things worse** — that's valuable too
3. **You can ignore the result** — but try the strategy first
4. **Discomfort is the point** — if it feels easy, you're not using it right

---

## When NOT to Use

- If you're in a flow state, don't interrupt it
- If you're ahead of schedule and the track is working
- During Lock-In or Cohesion days (different mindset needed)

But when you're:
- Stuck
- Repeating yourself
- Second-guessing
- Making it too complicated

**Pull a strategy and follow it blindly.**

---

## Create Your Own

Add project-specific strategies as you go:

- Strategy 81: _______________________________
- Strategy 82: _______________________________
- Strategy 83: _______________________________

> "These cards evolved from our separate observations on the principles underlying what we were doing. Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated. They can be used as a pack, or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. In this case the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear." — Brian Eno

Embrace the strategies. They're designed to short-circuit your habitual thinking and reveal new creative pathways.
