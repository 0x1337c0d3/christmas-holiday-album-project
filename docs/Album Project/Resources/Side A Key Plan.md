# Side A Key Plan

Complete harmonic roadmap for Side A tracks.

---

## Overview

Side A uses 5 distinct key centers that create a natural flow from bright/angular through darkness to calm.

**Tonal Arc:** A Mixolydian → C minor → Cm/Abm → Bb/Dmaj → E minor

This creates variety while maintaining coherence through:
- Related keys (relative majors/minors)
- Common tone connections
- Contrasting modes

---

## Track 1 — "Opening Fragment"

### Key: A Mixolydian / A Major-ish with colour tones

**Scale:** A - B - C# - D - E - F# - G - A

**Chord Progression:**
- A9 → Bbmaj7 → Gm9 → Cmaj9 → Fmaj9

**Analysis:**
- This is NOT diatonic A major — it's intentionally angular
- The Bb major chord creates immediate surprise (not in A major)
- The progression moves through unrelated keys
- Creates Bowie's "Low" side A energy — confident but unexpected

**Key Note:** The G natural (not G#) gives it Mixolydian flavor when used melodically, though the chords move freely.

**Why This Works:**
Bowie/Eno liked major tonalities that subvert themselves. This progression keeps listeners slightly off-balance from the first track.

---

## Track 2 — "Shadow Pop"

### Key: C minor → Eb major → G minor → F major

**Scale (C Natural Minor):** C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C

**Chord Progression:**
- Cm → Eb → Gm → F

**Analysis:**
- Straightforward minor key movement
- Cm and Gm are related (both in Eb major family)
- F major provides lift/brightness
- Creates mood shift after Track 1's complexity

**Relationship to Track 1:**
- No direct key relationship (A to C is a minor third)
- The shift from bright/angular to dark/groovy is intentional

**Why This Works:**
Creates contrast with opening track. The simpler progression allows the groove and texture to dominate.

---

## Track 3 — "Blue Glass"

### Key: C minor → Gb major → F major → Ab minor (collage)

**Scales Used:**
- C minor: C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb
- Gb major: Gb - Ab - Bb - Cb - Db - Eb - F
- Ab minor: Ab - Bb - Cb - Db - Eb - Fb - Gb

**Chord Progression:**
- Cm → Gb → F → Abm

**Analysis:**
- This is intentionally fragmented — it's a collage, not a progression
- Each chord is its own tonal world
- Gb major is a tritone away from C (maximum tension)
- Abm creates dark, ambiguous ending

**Relationship to Track 2:**
- Starts in same key (C minor) but diverges immediately
- The Gb is the "weirdness factor"

**Why This Works:**
This is your Eno/experimental track. The lack of traditional harmonic motion is the point. Each chord change can arrive with a texture shift instead of voice-leading.

---

## Track 4 — "Dislocation"

### Key: Bb major → D minor → D major → Dmaj7

**Scale (Bb Major):** Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G - A

**Chord Progression:**
- Bbmaj7 → Dm → D → Dmaj7 → Bb → A

**Analysis:**
- Starts in Bb major (familiar, stable)
- D minor is the relative minor's relative minor (complexity)
- **The shift from Dm → D → Dmaj7 is the magic moment**
- This major/minor shift on the same root creates surprise
- Return to Bb with A major ending (Picardy third concept)

**The "Magic Moment":**
When D minor becomes D major, it's like sunlight breaking through clouds. The major 7th adds sophistication.

**Why This Works:**
This is your "closest thing to a single." The D major shift is memorable and emotionally effective. The structure is clear enough to be catchy but weird enough to be Bowie-esque.

---

## Track 5 — "Small Resolution"

### Key: E minor → A minor → F# minor → F major

**Scale (E Natural Minor):** E - F# - G - A - B - C - D

**Chord Progression:**
- C → Em7 → Am7 → F#m7 → F

**Analysis:**
- E minor is calm, introspective
- A minor is subdominant (gentle movement)
- F#m is unexpected (not in E minor) — creates color
- F major ending (chromatic descent from F#m) prepares Side B

**Relationship to Track 4:**
- No direct key relationship
- The shift to softer minor key creates resolution

**The Fade to Drone:**
The final F major can morph into a drone that bleeds into Side B's C# Dorian (not directly related, but the ambiguity works).

**Why This Works:**
After the album's most "song-like" track (Track 4), this provides calm. The short length (2:30) and fade ending make it a perfect bridge to Side B's ambient world.

## Harmonic Overview

### Key Relationships:

```
Track 1: A Mixolydian (bright, angular)
           ↓ (minor 3rd down)
Track 2: C minor (dark, groovy)
           ↓ (stays in C minor tonality)
Track 3: C minor → Gb → F → Abm (experimental collage)
           ↓ (unrelated shift)
Track 4: Bb major → D major (catchy, major lift)
           ↓ (unrelated shift)
Track 5: E minor → F (calm landing)
```

### Why These Keys Work Together:

1. **Variety without chaos** — each track has distinct character
2. **Emotional arc** — bright → dark → weird → uplifting → calm
3. **Surprises embedded** — unexpected chords (Bbmaj7 in Track 1, D major in Track 4)
4. **No predictable circle-of-fifths** — maintains experimental edge

## Practical Usage

### For Composition:

When working on each track, **stay within the specified key/progression**. The limitations are intentional — they force creativity within constraints.

### For Improvisation:

Use the scales as melodic resources. You don't have to use every note, but staying within the scale keeps harmonic focus.

### For Cohesion:

The lack of traditional key relationships IS the Bowie/Eno aesthetic. Don't try to force connections — embrace the jumps.

---

## Common Tones (for subtle unity):

Despite the varied keys, some notes appear across multiple tracks:

- **C** appears in Tracks 1, 2, 3, 5
- **F** appears in all tracks
- **G** appears in Tracks 1, 2, 3, 4

You can use these as subtle connective tissue — a sustained C or F note that carries across transitions during Lock-In Day.

## Modal Flavor Guide

### Track 1 (A Mixolydian):
**Characteristic note:** G natural  
**Flavor:** Bright but not "happy" — has rock/blues edge

### Track 2 (C Natural Minor):
**Characteristic notes:** Eb, Ab, Bb  
**Flavor:** Dark, moody, serious

### Track 3 (Multiple/Ambiguous):
**Characteristic:** Jumps between tonal centers  
**Flavor:** Disorienting, collage-like, Eno-esque

### Track 4 (Bb Major → D Major):
**Characteristic moment:** The Dm → D → Dmaj7 shift  
**Flavor:** Surprising, uplifting, sophisticated

### Track 5 (E Natural Minor):
**Characteristic notes:** G, C, D (no leading tone)  
**Flavor:** Calm, modal, not pushing toward resolution

---

## Chord Voicing Tips

### For Prophet 12 (Pad Chords):
- Keep voicings in mid-range (C3 to C5)
- Leave gaps between notes (open voicings)
- Avoid thick clusters (max 4 notes)

### For Nord Lead 2X (Melodic Lines):
- Single note melodies or octaves
- Occasional 2-note intervals (5ths, 4ths)
- Avoid full chords on the lead synth

### For Moog Little Phatty (Bass):
- Single notes only (mono)
- Follow chord roots primarily
- Occasional passing tones for movement

---

## Advanced: Non-Functional Harmony

Side A doesn't follow traditional functional harmony (I-IV-V-I). Instead:

- **Coloristic harmony** — chords chosen for their timbral quality
- **Parallel motion** — chords moving in similar motion (Track 1)
- **Modal interchange** — borrowing chords from parallel modes (Track 4)
- **Collage approach** — unrelated chords juxtaposed (Track 3)

This is intentional and creates the "Low" aesthetic.

---

## Connection to Side B

**Track 5 ends:** F major (or F drone)  
**Side B begins:** C# Dorian

These are NOT related keys. The gap/shift is intentional — it marks the transition from "songs" to "ambient."

However, if you want subtle connection: both F and C# can coexist in ambiguous harmonic space if treated as drones (they're a tritone apart, which creates interesting tension).

---

## Summary

Side A's key plan creates:
- ✓ Variety (5 different key centers)
- ✓ Surprise (unexpected chord progressions)
- ✓ Emotional arc (bright → dark → weird → uplifting → calm)
- ✓ Bowie/Eno aesthetic (non-functional harmony)
- ✓ Practical constraints (each track has clear harmonic boundaries)

**Use this as your roadmap, not a prison.** If inspiration strikes and Track 3 wants to go to Eb instead of Gb, trust your ears. But the constraints exist to help, not hinder.
