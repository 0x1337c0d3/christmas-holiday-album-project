# Mono vs Stereo Recording Guide

Practical guidance for recording each hardware synth in mono or stereo for the album project.

---

## Philosophy

**Key Principle:** Record mono by default, stereo only when the synth's spatial character is essential to the sound.

**Why this matters:**
- Mono gives you mix authority (you decide width later)
- Mono anchors the center (crucial for Side A)
- Stereo should be earned, not inherited
- Bowie/Eno aesthetic: width from arrangement, not automatic stereo

---

## High-Level Decision Rule

> **If the synth's character comes from internal spatial interaction → stereo.**  
> **If the synth's power comes from tone, pitch, or rhythm → mono.**  
> **If in doubt → record mono and add space later.**

## Moog Little Phatty — MONO (always)

### Default: **MONO**

**Note:** The Moog Little Phatty is a monophonic instrument with a mono output. There is no stereo option. Always record in mono.

---

## Nord Lead 2X — MONO by default

### Default: **MONO**

### Why Mono:
- No true stereo oscillators
- No stereo filter paths
- No internal spatial FX worth preserving
- Any stereo is from unison detune/panning (better controlled in Ableton)

### Record MONO when:
- Bass (always)
- Sequences (always)
- Arpeggios (always)
- Rhythmic stabs (always)
- Melodic leads (default)

### Record STEREO only when:
- Extreme unison detune for motion (rare)
- Patch-internal panning modulation you want *printed* (rare)
- Stereo LFO tricks essential to the sound (very rare)

### Mix Benefits:
- Cuts through the center
- Leaves space for Prophet pads, FS1R atmospheres
- You control width via Utility/Chorus/Reverb later
- Aligns with Bowie/Eno mono sequences

### Decision Line:
> **If it's a Nord bass, sequence, arpeggio, or stab → MONO**  
> **If it's a pad or evolving texture → try mono first, widen later**

## VSynth XT — MONO by default, STEREO when spatial

### Default: **MONO**

### Why Often Mono:
- Most PCM and VA structures are mono internally
- COSM FX create stereo, not the core sound
- COSM decisions often better made in-mix

### Record MONO when:
- Drum hits (always — you're sampling anyway)
- Leads
- Rhythmic stabs
- Formant hits
- Short textures

### Record STEREO when:
- Granular / Time Trip pads
- Dual-COSM spatial patches
- Wide formant sweeps
- Evolving soundscapes (Side B)
- Textures that change shape over time

### Decision Line:
> **If the V-Synth patch changes shape over time → stereo.**  
> **If it punches → mono.**

---

## Yamaha FS1R — STEREO (almost always)

### Default: **STEREO**

### Why Stereo:
- Multi-operator interaction
- Formant movement across the spectrum
- Complex spectral motion
- Internal panning and phase behavior
- The "alive" quality lives in the stereo field

### Record STEREO when:
- Pads (always)
- Drones (always)
- Vocal-like textures (always)
- Evolving harmonic clouds (always)
- Side B movements (default)

### Record MONO only when:
- Percussive FM hits
- Short metallic stabs
- Sub-layer reinforcement
- Using it like a drum sound

### Mix Benefits:
- Preserves the formant magic
- Maintains spectral complexity
- Keeps the "inhuman voice" quality intact

### Decision Line:
> **If it's "FS1R being FS1R" → stereo.**  
> **If it's pretending to be a drum → mono.**

## Sequential Prophet 12 — STEREO for pads, MONO for structure

### Default: **Context-dependent**

### Why It Varies:
- Has stereo signal path and stereo delays
- Voice-level modulation can create width
- Not every patch needs that width

### Record MONO when:
- Bass (always)
- Arpeggios
- Sequences
- Harmonic rhythm parts
- Side A anchor material
- Structural elements

### Record STEREO when:
- Pads
- Evolving chord beds
- Ambient textures
- Side B harmonic clouds
- Emotional/atmospheric material

### Mix Benefits:
- Mono Prophet = solid harmonic foundation
- Stereo Prophet = immersive ambient space
- You choose which role it plays

### Decision Line:
> **If it's harmonic support → mono.**  
> **If it's emotional space → stereo.**

## Dave Smith Evolver — STEREO by design

### Default: **STEREO**

### Why Stereo:
- Fundamentally a stereo instrument
- Left/right signal paths
- Digital + analog cross-routing
- Stereo feedback path
- Stereo delays built-in
- **Recording mono removes half the instrument**

### Record STEREO when:
- Sequences (always)
- Evolving patches (always)
- Rhythmic modulation (always)
- Weird feedback textures (always)
- Side A movement layers (default)
- Experimental sounds (default)

### Record MONO only when:
- Deliberately collapsing for lo-fi effect (intentional choice)
- Using as bass reinforcement (rare)

### Decision Line:
> **If it's an Evolver sequence → stereo, no debate.**

## Quick Reference Table

| Synth | Default | Stereo When | Mono When |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Moog Little Phatty** | Mono | Never (mono only) | Always |
| **Nord Lead 2X** | Mono | Rare (extreme unison) | Bass / seq / arp (always) |
| **VSynth XT** | Mono | Granular / ambient / evolving | Drums / stabs / leads |
| **FS1R** | Stereo | Almost always | Perc hits only |
| **Prophet 12** | Depends | Pads / atmosphere | Arps / bass / structure |
| **Evolver** | Stereo | Almost always | Rare (intentional) |

## How This Serves Your Album Concept

### Side A (Song-Based):
- **Mono anchors** (Nord, Moog bass, Prophet structure)
- **Selective stereo movement** (Evolver, FS1R accents, Prophet pads)
- Result: Clarity and punch, Bowie/Eno aesthetic

### Side B (Ambient Suite):
- **Stereo-first soundscapes** (FS1R, Prophet pads, VSynth textures)
- **Mono only when anchoring** (rare)
- Result: Immersion and depth, Eno-style space

### Mix Stage:
- You *decide* where width lives
- Not inheriting it accidentally
- Can automate width changes
- Can collapse/expand per section

**This is how records like *Low* feel huge without being messy.**

## Adding Width in Ableton (When Recording Mono)

If you record mono and want width later:

### Tools:
1. **Ableton Utility** (Width 110-140%)
2. **Chorus / Ensemble** (subtle, for organic width)
3. **Short Haas delay** (≤ 15 ms, be careful)
4. **Reverb send** (don't print, control in mix)
5. **Mid/Side EQ** (boost sides at specific frequencies)

### When to Add Width:
- Side A: Selective (choruses, climaxes)
- Side B: Default for pads and textures
- Never on bass or kick (mono always)

---

## Practical Benefits of This Approach

### Workflow:
- Halves disk usage for mono tracks
- Simplifies routing (especially via ADAT)
- Speeds comping and bouncing
- Makes resampling painless

### Mix:
- Clean center (bass, kick, sequences)
- Controlled width (you decide where)
- Better phase coherence
- Easier to balance

### Creative:
- Forces discipline (earn the stereo)
- Prevents "smeared" mixes
- Aligns with Berlin Trilogy aesthetic
- Maintains punch and clarity

## Summary

**Record MONO by default:**
- Nord Lead 2X (always)
- Moog Little Phatty (always)
- Prophet 12 (bass, arps, structure)
- VSynth XT (drums, stabs, leads)

**Record STEREO by default:**
- FS1R (almost always)
- Evolver (almost always)
- Prophet 12 (pads, atmosphere)
- VSynth XT (granular, ambient)

**When in doubt:** Record mono, add width later. You can always make mono into stereo. You can't always make stereo into good mono.

**Remember:** *Low* used mono synth lines + arrangement for width. Trust the process.
