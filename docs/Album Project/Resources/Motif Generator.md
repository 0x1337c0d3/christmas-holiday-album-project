# Motif Generator

Tools for creating melodic and rhythmic starting points when you're stuck.

---

## How to Use

When you need a motif to begin a track:

1. Pick one **melodic contour**
2. Pick one **rhythmic feel**
3. Pick one **colour tone**
4. Combine them randomly

This gives you instant Bowie/Eno DNA.

## Melodic Contours

Choose one:

1. **Up major triad → step down two notes**
   - Example in C: C-E-G → F-E

2. **Stepwise rise of 5 notes, repeated**
   - Example in C: C-D-E-F-G (repeat with variation)

3. **Minor 3rd leap → whole-step echo**
   - Example in C: C-Eb-F (Eb is minor 3rd, F is whole step)

4. **Descending pentatonic fragment**
   - Example in C: G-E-D-C-A

5. **Tritone jump → slow fall**
   - Example in C: C-F#-E-D-C

6. **Arc shape (rise and fall)**
   - Example in C: C-D-E-F-E-D-C

7. **Question-Answer (4 notes + 4 notes)**
   - Example: C-D-E-F (question) / F-E-D-C (answer)

8. **Oscillating interval**
   - Example in C: C-G-C-G-C-A-C-A

9. **Chromatic crawl (3-5 notes)**
   - Example: C-C#-D-D#-E

10. **Wide leap + stepwise return**
    - Example in C: C-G-F-E-D-C

## Rhythmic Feels

Choose one:

1. **3 notes spaced: long–short–long**
   - Quarter, eighth, quarter

2. **Repeating dotted 8th pattern**
   - Bowie-esque feel, slightly off-kilter

3. **Straight 8ths but with one random accent**
   - Adds life to mechanical pattern

4. **Syncopated "push" on the 'and' before the bar**
   - Creates forward momentum

5. **One sustained note + one staccato answer**
   - Call and response within motif

6. **Triplet feel (3 against 4)**
   - Adds complexity without being "busy"

7. **Single note repeated, increasing speed**
   - Builds tension organically

8. **Polyrhythmic (5 notes over 4 beats)**
   - Drifts in and out of phase

9. **Sparse (one note every 2-3 seconds)**
   - Minimal, Eno-style approach

10. **Stuttering (short-short-long pattern)**
    - Mechanical, almost glitchy

## Colour Tones

Choose one to add harmonic interest:

1. **Add the 9th**
   - Example in C major: Add D
   - Creates openness

2. **Add the #11**
   - Example in C major: Add F#
   - Lydian flavor, floating quality

3. **Flatten the 5th**
   - Example in C major: Gb instead of G
   - Adds tension, darkness

4. **Add major 7th to a minor chord**
   - Example in C minor: Add B natural
   - Sophisticated, bittersweet

5. **Use open fifths only**
   - Example in C: Just C and G, no 3rd
   - Hollow, powerful, medieval

6. **Add the 6th**
   - Example in C major: Add A
   - Adds movement without dissonance

7. **Use sus4 instead of 3rd**
   - Example in C: C-F-G instead of C-E-G
   - Ambiguous, neither major nor minor

8. **Add the b9**
   - Example in C major: Add Db
   - Dissonant, creates tension

9. **Natural 7th (not major 7th)**
   - Example in C major: Add Bb
   - Mixolydian flavor, rock-ish

10. **Omit the root**
    - Example in C: Play E-G-B (no C)
    - Ambiguous, floating quality

## Example Combinations

### Combination 1:
- **Contour:** Up major triad → step down (C-E-G-F-E)
- **Rhythm:** Dotted 8th pattern
- **Colour:** Add the 9th (D appears somewhere)
- **Result:** Bright, slightly off-kilter, angular motif

### Combination 2:
- **Contour:** Descending pentatonic (G-E-D-C-A)
- **Rhythm:** Long-short-long
- **Colour:** Open fifths only
- **Result:** Minimal, powerful, grounded motif

### Combination 3:
- **Contour:** Question-answer
- **Rhythm:** Syncopated push
- **Colour:** Add major 7th to minor chord
- **Result:** Sophisticated, driving motif

### Combination 4:
- **Contour:** Tritone jump → slow fall (C-F#-E-D-C)
- **Rhythm:** Straight 8ths with one accent
- **Colour:** Flatten the 5th
- **Result:** Tense, Bowie-esque motif

## 5-Note Riff Ideas (for Side A)

Pre-built riff patterns for quick starts:

### In C minor:
1. **C - Eb - F - G - F** (minor pentatonic descent)
2. **G - F - Eb - D - C** (stepwise fall from 5th)
3. **C - D - Eb - G - C** (arc shape)
4. **Eb - F - G - Bb - G** (emphasize relative major)
5. **C - Eb - F - Ab - G** (dark, moody)

### In A major/Mixolydian:
1. **A - C# - E - D - C#** (triad + neighbor tones)
2. **E - D - C# - B - A** (descending from 5th)
3. **A - B - C# - E - F#** (ascending tension)
4. **C# - B - A - G - A** (Mixolydian emphasis on G)
5. **A - C# - D - E - D** (unexpected D natural)

### In D major/minor:
1. **D - F# - A - G - F#** (bright arc)
2. **D - E - F - G - A** (chromatic color)
3. **A - G - F# - E - D** (descending from 5th)
4. **D - F - A - Bb - A** (minor/major ambiguity)
5. **D - E - F# - A - C#** (building tension)

## Melodic Scales for Quick Reference

### A Mixolydian (Track 1):
**A - B - C# - D - E - F# - G - A**

Use these notes, emphasize the G natural (not G#) for Mixolydian flavor.

### C Natural Minor (Track 2):
**C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C**

Dark, moody. The Ab and Bb give it the minor character.

### C Dorian (alternate for Track 3):
**C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb - C**

Brighter than natural minor (A instead of Ab).

### Bb Major (Track 4):
**Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb**

Bright and stable. Shift to D minor/major for contrast.

### E Natural Minor (Track 5):
**E - F# - G - A - B - C - D - E**

Calm, introspective. Perfect for landing track.

## Rhythmic Notation Examples

### Dotted 8th Pattern:
```
[♪.] [♬] [♪.] [♬]
Long-short-long-short
```

### Long-Short-Long:
```
[♩] [♬] [♩]
Quarter-eighth-quarter
```

### Syncopated Push:
```
[♩] [♬] [♩] [♬]
1 - 2 + 3 - 4 +
(emphasis on 2+ and 4+)
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Motif Transformation:

Once you have a motif, transform it:

1. **Inversion** — flip it upside down
2. **Retrograde** — play it backwards
3. **Augmentation** — double the note lengths
4. **Diminution** — halve the note lengths
5. **Transposition** — move it to different starting pitch
6. **Rhythmic displacement** — shift it by a beat
7. **Fragmentation** — use only part of it
8. **Sequence** — repeat it at different pitches

### Motif Development:

Use your motif as:

1. **Main melody** — the obvious choice
2. **Bass line** — transpose it down
3. **Counter-melody** — play it against itself
4. **Harmonic rhythm** — let it guide chord changes
5. **Texture** — heavily processed in background
6. **Structural marker** — appears at section changes

## When to Use This Tool

**Use the Motif Generator when:**
- Starting a new track and feeling blank
- Your usual melodic habits are boring you
- You want to try something unexpected
- Time is limited and you need a quick start

**DON'T use it if:**
- You already have a strong idea
- You're in a flow state
- You're revisiting an existing track

## Motif Philosophy

> "The motif doesn't have to be 'good' — it has to be **usable**." — Peter Schmidt

Your motif is a tool, not the final product. It's there to:
- Give you a starting point
- Provide constraints
- Create unity across sections
- Be transformed and developed

**Trust the random combination.** Even if it seems odd at first, commit to it for the session.

---

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **Set timer for 2 minutes**
2. **Pick one from each category** (melodic, rhythmic, colour)
3. **Play it on your instrument**
4. **Record immediately** — no second-guessing
5. **Build track around it**

Done. Now you have a motif and can start composing.
