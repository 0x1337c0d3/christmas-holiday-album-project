Berlin Trilogy-inspired song sketches (Days 01-07).

---

## Overview

**Duration:** ~18-22 minutes  
**Tracks:** 5-6 short songs (~3-4 min each)  
**Aesthetic:** Angular, moody, experimental, sketch-like  
**Inspiration:** David Bowie's "Low" Side 1

---

## Track List

1. **Opening Fragment** — A Mixolydian, angular, confident start
2. **Shadow Pop** — C minor, groovy, dissolving ending
3. **Blue Glass** — Experimental collage, textural
4. **Dislocation** — Bb → Dmaj7, catchy centerpiece ("the single")
5. **Small Resolution** — Em, soft landing, fades to drone
6. *(Optional sixth track)*

## Creative Approach

### Constraints:
- **Max 2 synths + drums per track**
- **1-hour time limit per sketch**
- **No mixing, just capture ideas**
- **Minimal lyrics or none**
- **Heavy motifs, rhythmic or melodic hooks**

### Aesthetic Guidelines:
- Short motifs, not full songs
- Let imperfections stand
- Use abrupt endings or sudden changes
- Add weirdness: varispeed, harmonizer, odd envelopes
