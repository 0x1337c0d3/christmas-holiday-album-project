# Day 06 — Song Sketch 5

**Track:** Track 5 — "Small Resolution" (and optional Track 6)  
**Duration:** 2:30 (keep it short)  
**Time Budget:** 1 hour creative session

---

## Track Brief

### Harmonic Plan
- **Key:** Em → Am → F#m → F
- **Source progression:** C → Em7 → Am7 → F#m7 → F
- **Vibe:** Soft landing before the ambient world arrives
- **Why:** This is the bridge between Side A's songs and Side B's ambient suite

### Creative Approach
- Pick the "odd one": different mode, softer/lighter than previous tracks
- Keep it SHORT (2:30 max) — resist the urge to develop it fully
- Inspired by "Breaking Glass" or "Sound and Vision" structure: punchy, motif-driven, ends before you expect
- **Reuse a motif from Track 1 for unity** (album cohesion technique)

---

## Elements

**Telecaster Guitar OR Upright Piano:**
- This is your chance to use organic instruments
- Clean Telecaster arpeggios OR
- Upright piano with felt muting
- Keep it delicate and sparse

**Prophet 12 Chords:**
- Soft, supportive pads
- Lower volume than previous tracks
- Em → Am creates gentle, familiar movement

**Nord Lead (minimal):**
- **Bring back the motif from Track 1** (Opening Fragment)
- Quieter, reflective version
- This creates album-wide thematic connection

**Moog Bass (minimal or none):**
- If used, very subtle
- More felt than heard
- Could be just sustained low notes

**Drums (optional/minimal):**
- Could be NO drums at all
- OR just kick + closed hat, very restrained
- This track is about space and calm

---

## Process Guidelines

### Today's Focus: BREVITY & SPACE

This is your shortest track, and that's intentional:
- Creates variety in Side A pacing
- Acts as a palate cleanser
- Hints at the ambient space of Side B without fully entering it

**Approach:**
1. Start with guitar OR piano (pick one)
2. Add Prophet chords underneath
3. Bring in the Track 1 motif (transformed, quieter)
4. Optional: minimal bass/drums
5. **At 2:00-2:15, start fading into drone** (prepares for Side B)
6. End with just reverb tail or single sustained note

---

## Structure Suggestion

```
0:00 - 0:30   Telecaster/Piano alone
              Simple arpeggio or melodic figure
              Em → Am progression

0:30 - 1:00   Prophet chords enter softly
              Continue Em → Am, add F#m for color

1:00 - 1:30   Nord Lead: Track 1 motif returns
              Quiet, reflective
              This is your "callback" moment

1:30 - 2:00   Optional: minimal drums enter
              OR stay acoustic/organic only

2:00 - 2:30   Fade to drone/sustained note
              This bleeds directly into Side B's world
              Just reverb + one sustained pitch
```

## The Track 1 Motif Callback

**Why this matters:**
- Creates cohesion across the album
- Gives listener a sense of "coming full circle" on Side A
- Shows intentional composition, not just random sketches

**How to do it:**
1. Open Track 1 project
2. Find the main Nord Lead melodic motif (4-8 notes)
3. Copy that MIDI phrase
4. In Track 5, play it:
   - Slower tempo OR
   - Different register (octave down) OR
   - Different rhythm (stretch it out)
   - Quieter dynamics

It should be *recognizable but transformed* — like a memory, not a repeat.

---

## Telecaster Approach (Option A)

If using guitar:

**Clean DI with light chorus:**
- Simple picking pattern
- Arpeggiate Em, Am, F#m chords
- Each chord gets 4-8 bars
- No shredding, no complicated runs
- Think: ambient guitar, almost like a texture

**OR Volume Pedal Swells:**
- Pick note, swell volume in
- Creates pad-like texture from guitar
- Perfect for hinting at Side B aesthetic

---

## Upright Piano Approach (Option B)

If using piano:

**Heavily muted/felted:**
- Place cloth or felt on strings for soft attack
- Record with close mic for intimacy
- Simple chord progression
- Let notes ring, overlap naturally
- Drenched in reverb (long plate or hall)

**Single note melody:**
- Right hand: sparse melodic line
- Left hand: sustained bass notes or nothing

---

## The Fade to Drone

**Final 30 seconds are crucial** — this is where Side A hands off to Side B:

1. **2:00 mark:** Start fading out rhythm/melody
2. **2:10 mark:** Hold one note (E or C) on Prophet 12
3. **2:15 mark:** Add long reverb (8+ seconds)
4. **2:20 mark:** Everything else is gone except the drone
5. **2:30 mark:** Either:
   - Fade to silence (leave gap before Side B) OR
   - Let drone continue (Side B begins from this)

This creates a sonic bridge without being too obvious.

---

## Optional Track 6

**If energy is high** and you finish Track 5 in under 45 minutes:

You can sketch a sixth track for Side A. This is **completely optional**.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it SHORT (2-3 min)
- Use a different mood than Tracks 1-5
- Could be purely instrumental
- Could be an interlude or transitional piece
- Don't stress if you skip this — 5 tracks is plenty

---

## Oblique Strategy for Today

1. **Let the texture be the melody** (guitar/piano focus)
2. **Pretend one synth is broken; don't use it for 3 days** (focus on organic)
3. **Only use sounds from Side B for a Side A track** (the drone ending)
4. **Pick one chord and refuse to leave it** (could apply to the drone section)

## Export Checklist

- [ ] Bounce rough mix: `A05_Small_Resolution_2025-12-XX.wav`
- [ ] Optional Track 6: `A06_Title_2025-12-XX.wav`
- [ ] Save projects clearly
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Write note: Does the motif callback work? Does the ending fade feel natural?
- [ ] **Stop** — Side A sketches are complete!

---

## Daily Checklist

- [ ] Choose: Guitar OR Piano (organic focus today)
- [ ] Create simple arpeggio/melodic figure
- [ ] Add Prophet 12 soft pads
- [ ] Bring back Track 1 motif (Nord Lead, transformed)
- [ ] Optional: minimal bass/drums
- [ ] Create fade to drone (final 30 seconds)
- [ ] Keep it SHORT (2:30 max)
- [ ] Bounce rough mix
- [ ] Optional: Sketch Track 6 if time/energy permits
- [ ] Label clearly
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Stop — prepare for Day 7 lock-in

---

## Remember

**By end of Day 6, Side A sketches should include:**
1. Opening Fragment (angular, bright)
2. Shadow Pop (dark, groovy)
3. Blue Glass (experimental, collage)
4. Dislocation (catchy, song-like)
5. Small Resolution (soft, transitional) ✓
6. (Optional sixth track)

**Tomorrow is Lock-In Day** — you'll choose running order, add connective elements, and finalize Side A structure. Today's job is just to capture Track 5's essence.

**Key Feature:** The fade to drone is your first explicit connection to Side B's ambient world.
