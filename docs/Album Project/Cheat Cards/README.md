# Cheat Cards

Quick-reference daily guides for your 14-day album project.

## What Are Cheat Cards?

Each day has a dedicated cheat card that serves as your primary workflow guide. Think of them as your "mission brief" for each session.

**Each card includes:**
- Day's objective and focus
- Time budget
- Track/movement brief (key, mood, vibe)
- Step-by-step workflow
- Element list (instruments, layers)
- Structure suggestions
- Process guidelines
- Export checklist
- Links to related resources

## How to Use

1. **One card per day** — follow in sequence
2. **Read the entire card before starting** — understand the day's goal
3. **Use as reference during session** — keep it open while working
4. **Check off the export checklist** — ensures nothing is forgotten
5. **Move to next card** — resist revisiting previous days until Lock-In

## Philosophy

The cheat card system is designed to:

✓ **Eliminate decision fatigue** — every decision is pre-made  
✓ **Maintain momentum** — one clear task per day  
✓ **Prevent overthinking** — constraints force action  
✓ **Ensure completion** — checkboxes create satisfaction  
✓ **Build confidence** — small wins accumulate

**Trust the system. Follow the cards. Make the album.**
