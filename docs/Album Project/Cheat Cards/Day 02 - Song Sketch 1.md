# Day 02 — Song Sketch 1

**Track:** Track 1 — "Opening Fragment"  
**Duration:** 3 min  
**Time Budget:** 1 hour creative session

---

## Track Brief

### Harmonic Plan
- **Key:** A Mixolydian / A Major-ish with colour tones
- **Source progression:** A9 → Bbmaj7 → Gm9 → Cmaj9 → Fmaj9
- **Vibe:** Angular, unexpected, confident start
- **Why:** Bowie/Eno liked major tonalities that subvert themselves

### Creative Approach
- Pick tempo + motif (10 min)
- Record drum loop, bass idea, top-line, synth part (40 min)
- Bounce, no perfection (10 min)

---

## Elements

**Nord Lead 2X Motif:**
- Bright, punchy digital tone for the main hook
- Keep it jumpy; abrupt changes are a feature, not a bug

**Prophet 12 Chords:**
- Glassy modulated chords for harmonic bed
- Use the A9 → Bbmaj7 progression for unexpected color

**Moog Bass:**
- Mono, simple, one oscillator detuned lightly
- Ground the angular harmonies

**Evolver Bleeps:**
- Unpredictable movement
- Add Bowie-era weirdness as texture layer

**Drums:**
- Use your sampled VSynth XT/Volca Drum Rack
- Keep it tight and minimal

---

## Process Guidelines

### What to Do:
1. **Choose tempo** (Start somewhere between 95-115 BPM for Side A feel)
2. **Program drums first** — 8 or 16-bar loop maximum
3. **Add bass line** — follow the root progression but leave gaps
4. **Layer chord progression** — don't fill every bar
5. **Add one melodic motif** — 4-8 notes maximum, repeated with variation
6. **Add one texture layer** from the Evolver
7. **Record 2-3 minutes** of this arrangement
8. **Bounce and stop** — resist the urge to perfect

### What NOT to Do:
- Don't tweak sounds for more than 5 minutes
- Don't record multiple takes trying to get it "right"
- Don't mix or add effects beyond your template buses
- Don't revisit yesterday's work

---

## Structure Suggestion

Keep it Bowie-esque and fragmentary:

```
0:00 - 0:20   Drums + Bass (minimal intro)
0:20 - 0:50   Add chords (A9 → Bbmaj7 → Gm9)
0:50 - 1:30   Introduce Nord motif
1:30 - 2:10   Evolver texture enters, chords shift
2:10 - 2:45   Drop to drums + bass + motif only
2:45 - 3:00   Abrupt ending or sudden texture change
```

You don't have to follow this exactly — use it as a loose guide if you get stuck.

## Motif Generator (Use If Stuck)

Pick one from each column:

**Melodic contour:**
- Up major triad → step down two notes ✓ (fits A major tonality)
- Minor 3rd leap → whole-step echo
- Descending pentatonic fragment

**Rhythmic feel:**
- 3 notes spaced: long–short–long
- Repeating dotted 8th pattern ✓ (Bowie-esque)
- Syncopated "push" on the 'and' before the bar

**Colour tone:**
- Add the 9th ✓ (you're already using A9)
- Add the #11 (creates Lydian flavor)
- Add major 7th to a minor chord

## Oblique Strategy for Today

Choose one if you need a creative jolt:

1. **Commit to the first take; forbid yourself a second**
2. **Play the progression backwards**
3. **Do the whole sketch with one finger on the keyboard**
4. **Freeze a mistake and build around it**

---

## Export Checklist

Before moving to Day 03:

1. **Bounce rough mix** — label: `A01_Opening_Fragment_2025-12-XX.wav`
2. **Optional: Export stems** if you think you'll want them later
3. **Save project** — clear naming: `Track01_Opening_Fragment.als`
4. **Back up** to external drive or cloud
5. **Write 1-2 sentence note** about what worked or what to remember
6. **Stop working** — resist the urge to "just fix one thing"

---

## Daily Checklist

- [ ] Pick tempo + key (already chosen: A Mixolydian)
- [ ] Choose *two* synths max for chords/lead (Nord + Prophet)
- [ ] Create one motif (melody or rhythmic idea)
- [ ] Build a harmonic bed (Prophet 12 chords)
- [ ] Add one texture layer (Evolver)
- [ ] Add bass (Moog)
- [ ] Add drums (Drum Rack)
- [ ] Bounce a rough 2–3 min sketch
- [ ] Label it clearly (date + track name)
- [ ] Export stems if useful
- [ ] Back up the project
- [ ] Stop — no perfection; move on

---

## Remember

**The creative flash → capture pipeline:**

This is where the magic happens. You're not building a cathedral — you're catching lightning in a jar.

- Fast harmony choices
- One core motif
- Rough structure
- 2–3 layers of texture
- A "this is what the track *is*" identity

When you stop, it should feel like a **finished sketch**, not a loop.
