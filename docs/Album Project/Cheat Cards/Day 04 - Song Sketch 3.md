# Day 04 — Song Sketch 3

**Track:** Track 3 — "Blue Glass"  
**Duration:** 2-3 min  
**Time Budget:** 1 hour creative session

---

## Track Brief

### Harmonic Plan
- **Key:** C minor → G minor → Ab minor (pivot)
- **Source progression:** Cm → Gb → F → Abm
- **Vibe:** Tense collage; Eno-like tape-loop energy. Abrupt edits allowed
- **Why:** This is your experimental track — almost collage-like structure

### Creative Approach
- **Start with CHORDS first today** (Day 2 was harmony, Day 3 was rhythm, Day 4 returns to harmony)
- Build texture-focused arrangement
- Each chord change can arrive with a texture shift instead of drums
- Embrace abrupt edits and jarring transitions

---

## Elements

**VSynth XT Artifacts:**
- Time-stretched sounds
- Granular textures
- Formant-evolving patches
- This is the star of the track

**Prophet 12 Chords:**
- Static, held chords
- Each chord should be its own "section"
- Minimal movement within chords

**Nord Lead (optional/minimal):**
- Small melodic fragments
- Sparse, not continuous
- Think "punctuation" not "melody"

**Drums (minimal):**
- Consider using NO traditional drums
- Or just kick + hat, very stripped back
- Texture is the rhythm today

**Moog Bass (optional):**
- May not be needed at all
- If used, just sustained root notes

## Process Guidelines

### Today's Focus: TEXTURE > STRUCTURE

This track breaks the "song" format. Think of it as:
- 3-4 distinct sections
- Each section = one chord + one texture world
- Transitions can be abrupt (cuts, not fades)

### Workflow:

1. **Choose 3-4 chords** from your progression
2. **Create one VSynth texture per chord** (record 30-60 sec of each)
3. **Arrange them as blocks** with hard edits between
4. **Add Prophet chords** underneath as glue
5. **Optional: Add sparse drums or clicks**
6. **Optional: One melodic fragment** that appears twice

## Structure Suggestion (Collage Style)

```
0:00 - 0:40   Section 1: Cm drone + VSynth granular texture
              (no drums, just texture + chord)

0:40 - 1:20   Section 2: Abrupt cut to Gb + different VSynth patch
              (maybe add single kick hits, sparse)

1:20 - 2:00   Section 3: F with tape-loop-style repeating fragment
              (Nord Lead small motif enters)

2:00 - 2:30   Section 4: Abm + combination of textures
              (everything at once, then sudden stop)

2:30 - 2:45   Coda: Just VSynth texture, no harmony, fade out
```

## VSynth XT Texture Ideas

Prepare 3-4 distinct textures before you start arranging:

1. **Granular Stretch** — freeze a piano note, stretch 800%, add formant
2. **Time-Stretched Vocal** — use the XT's vocal modeling, extreme time
3. **Filtered Noise Sweep** — bandpass automation, slow movement
4. **Formant Morph** — vowel sounds evolving over 30 seconds

Record each as a 60-second audio clip, then chop and arrange in Ableton.

## The "Collage" Mindset

Unlike Tracks 1 & 2, which had traditional song structure:
- **No verse/chorus thinking**
- **Each section is its own world**
- **Transitions are intentionally jarring**
- **Bowie's "Art Decade" or Eno's "1/1" vibe**

This gives your album variety and keeps Side A from being too predictable.

---

## Chord Voicings

Keep them simple and static:

- **Cm:** C - Eb - G (root position, mid-range)
- **Gb:** Gb - Bb - Db (first inversion if you want tension)
- **F:** F - A - C (or F - C - F for hollow feel)
- **Abm:** Ab - Cb - Eb (dark, sustained)

Play each chord as a pad that sustains 30-40 seconds without change.

---

## When to Use Drums (Or Not)

**Option A: No drums at all** — pure ambient/texture track  
**Option B: Minimal percussion** — single kick hits, sparse hats for punctuation  
**Option C: Drums only in one section** — enter at 1:20, then disappear again

The lack of consistent rhythm makes this track stand out on Side A.

## Oblique Strategy for Today

1. **Freeze a mistake and build around it** ✓ (perfect for VSynth experimentation)
2. **Replace rhythm with texture** ✓ (this is the whole concept)
3. **Introduce one "ugly" sound and make it essential**
4. **Let the texture be the melody**

## Export Checklist

- [ ] Bounce rough mix: `A03_Blue_Glass_2025-12-XX.wav`
- [ ] Optional: Export stems (especially keep those VSynth textures)
- [ ] Save project: `Track03_Blue_Glass.als`
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Write note: Which textures worked? Which transitions felt right?
- [ ] **Stop** — resist the urge to smooth out the jarring parts

---

## Daily Checklist

- [ ] Pick tempo (or no tempo — free time sections are okay)
- [ ] Start with CHORDS first (Prophet 12)
- [ ] Create 3-4 VSynth XT textures
- [ ] Arrange as collage (hard edits between sections)
- [ ] Optional: add minimal drums
- [ ] Optional: add one sparse melodic fragment
- [ ] Bounce rough mix (2-3 min target)
- [ ] Label clearly
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Stop — embrace the weirdness

---

## Remember

**By Day 4, you should have:**
- Track 1: Angular, bright, confident
- Track 2: Dark, rhythmic, dissolving ending
- Track 3: Experimental, textural, collage-like

This variety is what makes an album interesting. Don't worry if Track 3 sounds "different" — that's the point.

**Rule:** Abrupt edits are a feature, not a bug. This is Bowie/Eno territory.
