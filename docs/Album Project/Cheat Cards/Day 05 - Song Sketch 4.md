# Day 05 — Song Sketch 4

**Track:** Track 4 — "Dislocation"  
**Duration:** ~3 min  
**Time Budget:** 1 hour creative session

---

## Track Brief

### Harmonic Plan
- **Key:** Bb major → D minor → D → Dmaj7
- **Source progression:** Bbmaj7 → Dm → D → Dmaj7 → Bb → A
- **Vibe:** Feels like Low side A: short, catchy, harmonic sleight-of-hand
- **Why:** This is the "closest thing to a single" — most song-like track on Side A

### Creative Approach
- **Start with RHYTHM first today** (alternating from Day 4's chord-first approach)
- This should feel the most "complete" and traditional of all Side A tracks
- Add one melodic hook that's hummable
- Keep structure simple: A / B / A

---

## Elements

**Nord Lead 2X:**
- **Main melodic hook** — this is your "chorus" equivalent
- Bright, catchy, memorable
- 8-12 note phrase maximum
- Should be immediately recognizable

**Prophet 12 Chords:**
- Supportive role, not dominant
- Quick chord changes (Bb → Dm creates good tension)
- The D → Dmaj7 shift is your "magic moment"

**Moog Bass:**
- Clear, present, driving
- Can be slightly more melodic than previous tracks
- Follows roots but adds passing notes

**Drums:**
- Full kit, consistent throughout
- More prominent than Tracks 1-3
- Think "Sound and Vision" steady pulse

**Optional Guitar/Piano:**
- If you want extra texture, add clean Telecaster arpeggios OR
- Upright piano soft chords in the B section

---

## Process Guidelines

### Today's Focus: Make Something CATCHY

After three experimental/moody tracks, Track 4 needs to be the most accessible.

**The Hook:**
- Write a melodic phrase you can hum
- It should appear at least 3 times in the track
- Use the Nord Lead's bright, punchy sound

**The Structure:**
- Verse-like section (A)
- Different section (B) 
- Return to first section (A)
- This gives it traditional song shape without being too conventional

---

## Structure Suggestion (A/B/A)

```
0:00 - 0:10   Drums + Bass intro (establish groove)

0:10 - 0:45   SECTION A (Bb → Dm)
              - Add main melodic hook (Nord)
              - Prophet chords support
              - This is your "verse"

0:45 - 1:30   SECTION B (D → Dmaj7)
              - Chord shift creates lift
              - Variation on the hook OR new melodic idea
              - Optional: guitar/piano enters here
              - This is your "chorus" or "bridge"

1:30 - 2:15   SECTION A (return)
              - Same as first A section
              - Maybe add one extra layer for interest

2:15 - 2:45   OUTRO
              - Strip back to drums + hook
              - Fade OR abrupt stop (Bowie-style)

2:45 - 3:00   (Optional: brief silence or texture tail)
```

## The Melodic Hook

This is the centerpiece of the track. Here's how to approach it:

### Characteristics:
- **8-12 notes maximum**
- **Uses the Bb major scale with D minor color**
- **Rhythmically distinctive** (dotted rhythms or syncopation)
- **Repeats with slight variation**

### Hook Generator (pick one approach):

**Option 1: Ascending Arc**
- Start on D, rise to Bb, descend to F
- Rhythmic pattern: long-short-short-long

**Option 2: Question-Answer**
- 4-note phrase rising (question)
- 4-note phrase falling (answer)
- Repeat this pair twice

**Option 3: Ostinato with Variation**
- 4-6 note repeating pattern
- Change one note on each repeat
- Creates hypnotic but evolving feel

---

## The Harmonic "Magic Moment"

**The D → Dmaj7 shift is crucial:**

- D minor is your home base (from Bb major key)
- When you shift to D major, it creates surprise
- The maj7 adds sophistication
- This happens in Section B

**How to emphasize it:**
1. Let the D major chord arrive with slight pause
2. Hold the Dmaj7 for 4-8 bars
3. Have your melodic hook respond to the chord change
4. This is where the track "opens up"

---

## The "Single" Mindset

Think of this as the track someone might remember after hearing the album once:

- ✓ Clear structure (not collage-like)
- ✓ Memorable melody (not just texture)
- ✓ Consistent drums (not sparse)
- ✓ Defined sections (not continuous evolution)

But still maintain the Bowie/Eno aesthetic:
- Keep it under 3 minutes
- Allow for some weirdness in the sounds
- Don't overproduce
- Abrupt ending is still an option

---

## Tempo Suggestion

**100-108 BPM** — upbeat enough to feel driving, but not rushed.

This gives it energy without being frantic.

---

## Oblique Strategy for Today

Since this is your most "normal" track, use strategies that add interesting limitations:

1. **Do the whole sketch with one finger on the keyboard** (forces simplicity)
2. **Commit to the first take; forbid yourself a second** (captures spontaneity)
3. **Visually hide your chord chart; play by memory** (trusts your instincts)
4. **Finish in 20 minutes; stop no matter what** (prevents overthinking)

## Export Checklist

- [ ] Bounce rough mix: `A04_Dislocation_2025-12-XX.wav`
- [ ] Optional: Export stems (this one might be worth keeping stems)
- [ ] Save project: `Track04_Dislocation.als`
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Write note: Is the hook memorable? Does the D→Dmaj7 shift land?
- [ ] **Stop** — this is a sketch, not a finished production

---

## Daily Checklist

- [ ] Pick tempo (100-108 BPM suggested)
- [ ] Start with RHYTHM first (drums + bass)
- [ ] Create main melodic hook (Nord Lead) — MOST IMPORTANT
- [ ] Build chord progression (Bb → Dm → D → Dmaj7)
- [ ] Structure as A / B / A sections
- [ ] Optional: add guitar or piano texture
- [ ] Bounce rough mix (~3 min)
- [ ] Label clearly
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Stop — the hook either works or it doesn't; move on

---

## Remember

**After Day 5, you should have:**
- Track 1: Angular, experimental
- Track 2: Dark, groovy, dissolving
- Track 3: Collage, textural
- Track 4: Catchy, most song-like ✓

This creates the perfect arc for Side A. Track 5 tomorrow will be the calm landing before Side B's ambient suite.

**Key Difference:** This track should be the one you could imagine playing for someone who asks "what's your album like?"
