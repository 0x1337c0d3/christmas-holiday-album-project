# Day 01 — Concept and Sound Palette

**Duration:** 1 hour max

## Objective

Establish your creative foundation and lock in the sound world for the entire album to avoid decision fatigue during your 1-hour creative sprints.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Define Your Sound World

Pick your core instruments and commit to them:

- **Max 2 synths + 1 drum source per track** (for Side A)
- Choose rough keys/modes for Side A (3–4 related keys)
- Choose tone for Side B (one drone root or two shifting tonal centres)

### 2. Build Your Core Palette

Create **1–2 patches per synth** you plan to use. These are your *default brushes* — reliable, neutral starting points that always sound good.

**Purpose:** Eliminate decision fatigue. You're not trying to build "perfect" patches — just instant paint so when you sit down for Track 1, you're not wasting half your creative hour scrolling presets.

#### Side A Sound Palette

**Lead / Motif Synth:**
- *Nord Lead 2X* — bright, punchy digital tone, perfect Bowie-esque top lines

**Chords / Harmonic Bed:**
- *Prophet 12* — hybrid pads, glassy modulated chords

**Bass:**
- *Moog Little Phatty* — keep it mono, simple, one oscillator detuned lightly

**Odd Noise / Texture:**
- *Evolver* — unpredictable movement, perfect for Bowie-era weirdness

**Drums:**
- VSynth XT + Volca Beats (sampled into Ableton Drum Rack)
- Ableton's *Drum Buss + vinyl emulation* for a dry 70s feel

#### Side B Sound Palette

**Primary Pad Engine:**
- *Yamaha FS1R* — formant-rich evolving pads. This will carry Side B.

**Secondary Texture:**
- *VSynth XT* — granular stretches, frozen chords, time-manipulation

**Sub Drone Layer:**
- *Prophet 12* long release, low-pass 6dB, slow envelope LFO

**Melodic Ghost Layer:**
- *Telecaster with Ebow or reverb wash*. Let it vanish into the mix, nothing rhythmic.

**Field ambience:**
- Minimal: room tone, pedal squeaks from the piano, mechanical hum

**Piano (optional):**
- Upright piano, heavily felt-muted, drenched in delays

### 3. Create Your Ableton Template

Set up a single "template" session in Ableton with:
- MIDI tracks routed to hardware
- Drum channels premapped
- Reverb buses A (short plate for Side A) + B (long hall for Side B)
- External Instrument tracks for your hardware synths

### 4. Sample Your Drums (Critical for Side A Consistency)

**Why Sample Instead of Running VSynth XT Live?**
- Instant recall (zero menu-diving)
- Consistency across all 5–6 Side A tracks
- Layer XT + Volca sounds nondestructively
- Tight integration with Ableton template
- More CPU for your hardware synths

**What to Sample:**
Record 8–12 hits of each sound at soft, medium, and hard velocities:
- XT kick (primary)
- Volca kick (overdrive) — ALT for 1 track only
- XT Snare #14 (tight digital)
- XT Snare #33 (metallic/bitcrushed) — ALT
- XT Closed Hat #06
- Volca Beats open hat (noisy, use sparingly)
- 3–5 FX/Perc samples: metallic click, reverse noise burst, low tom, processed rimshot, woodblock/tick

**Processing Chain (Apply to ALL drum samples):**
- 2–5% distortion
- Short plate reverb (0.3–0.5s)
- Slight tape wobble
- HP filter at ~180–250 Hz

## Sound Design Philosophy

### Fix 80% of the palette up front, design 20% on the fly

You want to **eliminate decision fatigue**, but not kill spontaneity.

**Before Day 1:** Create your "Core Palette" (1–2 hours total)

**During the 1-hour creative session:** Minor, fast sound-design only:
- Quick filter movement
- Basic envelope tweaks
- Light effect adjustments
- No deep sound design

---

## Hardware vs Sampling Strategy

**Your audio chain:** Synth → Apogee Ensemble → ADAT → RME BabyFace

### Sample Upfront:
1. **Drum kit (Volca + VSynth XT)** — consistency across tracks
2. **Unstable/drifty hardware patches** — lock the magic before it wanders
3. **CPU-intensive device chains** — keep session light

### Run Live Over MIDI:
1. **Harmonic engines** — pads, chord beds, evolving keys
2. **Melodic synths / leads** — envelopes, mod wheel, aftertouch, vibrato
3. **Bass synths** — real-time micro-adjustment

**Simple Rule:**
> If it's rhythmic → sample  
> If it's expressive → run live  
> If it's ambient → decide based on CPU

## Key Decisions for Side A

Based on your chord progressions:

### Track 1 — "Opening Fragment"
- **Key:** A Mixolydian / A Major-ish with colour tones
- **Progression:** A9 → Bbmaj7 → Gm9 → Cmaj9 → Fmaj9
- **Vibe:** Angular, unexpected, confident start

### Track 2 — "Shadow Pop"
- **Key:** C minor → Eb major → Gm → F
- **Vibe:** Mood lift/shift after bold opening. Darker colour, more rhythmic

### Track 3 — "Blue Glass"
- **Key:** C minor → G minor → Ab minor (pivot)
- **Vibe:** Tense collage; Eno-like tape-loop energy. Abrupt edits allowed

### Track 4 — "Dislocation"
- **Key:** Bb major → D minor → D → Dmaj7
- **Vibe:** Feels like Low side A: short, catchy, harmonic sleight-of-hand. "Closest thing to a single"

### Track 5 — "Small Resolution"
- **Key:** Em → Am → F#m → F
- **Vibe:** Soft landing before ambient world arrives. Keep it short (2:30). Reuse motif from Track 1 for unity

## Side B Modal Plan

### Movement I — "Arrival in Stillness"
- **Mode:** C# Dorian
- **Drone root:** C#
- **Colours:** Add 9th (D#) or natural 6th (A#) for movement

### Movement II — "Soft Machinery"
- **Mode:** E Mixolydian
- **Drone root:** E
- **Pivot:** Glide from C# Dorian by introducing G# (common tone)

### Movement III — "Night Structures"
- **Mode:** B Aeolian
- **Drone root:** B
- **Pivot:** E Mixolydian shares A and B — crossfade pads

### Movement IV (Optional) — "Dissolve"
- **Mode:** C Lydian
- **Drone root:** C
- **Pivot:** Move from B Aeolian by raising B to C and introducing F♯

**Tonal Arc:** C# → E → B → C (feels natural, like slowly rising into light)

## What to Prep Before Starting Day 2

1. Load all palette patches in each synth
2. Save DAW defaults for Side A and Side B tracks
3. Pre-process your 3–5 drum/percussion samples
4. Build Ableton template with routing
5. Test recording of every hardware source once
6. Verify recall/patch numbers and label them
7. **Stop. Don't over-prepare.**

---

## Creative Constraints (Critical for Success)

- Max **2 synths** + **1 drum source** per track
- No mixing, no perfect sound design
- Only *sketches*: melody + harmony + rhythm + basic texture
- Export **stems or bounces each day** so you don't lose momentum

---

## Aesthetic Guide

### Side A (Bowie Low vibe)
- Short motifs, not full songs
- Let imperfections stand
- Use abrupt endings or sudden changes
- Add weirdness: varispeed vocals, harmonizer, odd envelopes

### Side B (Jarre ambient)
- Long-form, slow-changing pads
- Sparse melodic material
- Let tracks breathe 2–3 minutes before introducing any motion
- Minimum of 3 layers per piece:
  - drone
  - ambience (noise, texture, field recording)
  - slow melody or harmonic motion
