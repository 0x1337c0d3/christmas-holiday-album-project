# Day 07 — Side A Lock-In

**Goal:** Finalize Side A structure  
**Time Budget:** 2-3 hours (this is a bigger day)

---

## Objective

Transform your 5-6 individual sketches into a cohesive Side A by:
1. Choosing the final track order
2. Adding small connective motifs between tracks
3. Light arrangement additions (one extra part per track)
4. Exporting everything cleanly

**This is NOT mixing day** — still working with rough sketches, but making them feel like an album side rather than disconnected tracks.

---

## Task 1: Choose Running Order (30 minutes)

### Process:

1. **Listen to all sketches in silence** (no working, just listening)
2. **Take notes on:**
   - Which track feels like the strongest opener?
   - Which tracks have similar energy (don't put them back-to-back)
   - Which track makes the best ending?
   - Do any tracks feel unnecessary?

3. **Try different sequences:**
   - Export a rough assembly of tracks in different orders
   - Listen to transitions between tracks
   - Which order creates the best flow?

### Suggested Order (based on the track briefs):

```
A01 - Opening Fragment      (angular, bright — strong opener)
A02 - Shadow Pop             (darker shift, groovy)
A03 - Blue Glass             (experimental break, texture)
A04 - Dislocation            (catchy centerpiece, most "single")
A05 - Small Resolution       (calm landing, fades to drone)
A06 - (Optional sixth track)
```

But **trust your ears** — if a different order feels better, use it.

### Rules:
- **Don't put two experimental tracks back-to-back** (Blue Glass should have "normal" tracks before/after)
- **The ending should feel conclusive OR transitional** (Small Resolution works because it hints at Side B)
- **Total runtime target:** ~18-22 minutes for Side A

---

## Task 2: Add Connective Motifs (45 minutes)

Now that you have the order, add small elements that tie tracks together.

### Technique 1: Recurring Texture
- Pick one sound/texture (e.g., a specific Evolver patch or VSynth grain)
- Add a brief instance (5-10 seconds) of it in 3 different tracks
- Same sound, different context
- This creates subliminal continuity

### Technique 2: Melodic Callback
- We already used Track 1's motif in Track 5
- Consider: Can you sneak the Track 1 motif into Track 4 as well?
- Just a hint — 2-4 notes buried in the background

### Technique 3: Harmonic Thread
- You have several tracks in minor keys (Cm, Em, Dm)
- Add a sustained note that appears in multiple tracks
- Example: Low C drone underneath Track 2, Track 3, and Track 5
- Subtle harmonic glue

**Pick ONE technique** — don't overdo this. Album cohesion should feel natural, not forced.

---

## Task 3: Add One Extra Part to Each Track (60 minutes)

Give each sketch one additional layer — this adds depth without making it overproduced.

### Track 1 (Opening Fragment):
- **Add:** Counter-melody or rhythmic texture in the middle section
- Could be: Nord Lead second layer, or Evolver rhythmic pulse

### Track 2 (Shadow Pop):
- **Add:** Bridge section or textural buildup before the dissolve
- Could be: Extra pad layer that swells, or filtered noise

### Track 3 (Blue Glass):
- **Add:** One melodic fragment that appears twice
- Could be: Simple piano melody, or clean synth line as anchor

### Track 4 (Dislocation):
- **Add:** Background arpeggio or rhythmic guitar
- Could be: Telecaster clean picking, or Prophet 12 arpeggiated chords

### Track 5 (Small Resolution):
- **Add:** Nothing (it's already minimal)
- OR: One extra harmonic layer during the drone fade

**Budget: Maximum 10-12 minutes per track** for these additions.

---

## Task 4: Balance & Light Automation (30 minutes)

This is NOT mixing, but you can do some basic housekeeping:

### Level Balancing:
- Listen to the full Side A sequence
- Are any tracks dramatically louder/quieter?
- Adjust master faders so the overall flow feels balanced
- Target: roughly –14 to –10 LUFS (informal check)

### Automation (Light):
- Filter automation for builds/transitions
- Reverb send automation (pull back in dense sections, increase in sparse)
- Volume fade automation for endings

**Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this** — it's still rough mixes.

---

## Task 5: Export Stems & Roughs (30 minutes)

### For Each Track:

**Rough Mix:**
```
A01_Opening_Fragment_ROUGH_2025-12-XX.wav
A02_Shadow_Pop_ROUGH_2025-12-XX.wav
...etc
```

**Stems (Optional but Recommended):**
Create folders for each track with stems:
```
Track01_Opening_Fragment/
  ├── Drums.wav
  ├── Bass.wav
  ├── Prophet_Chords.wav
  ├── Nord_Lead.wav
  ├── Evolver_Texture.wav
  └── MIX.wav
```

**Full Side A Assembly:**
- Concatenate all tracks (with appropriate gaps/fades)
- Export as: `SIDE_A_ROUGH_MASTER_2025-12-XX.wav`

---

## Task 6: Documentation (15 minutes)

Create a simple text file with notes:

```markdown
# Side A - Track Notes

## Track Order:
1. Opening Fragment (3:05) — A Mixolydian
2. Shadow Pop (3:38) — C minor
3. Blue Glass (2:47) — Cm → Abm collage
4. Dislocation (3:12) — Bb → D → Dmaj7
5. Small Resolution (2:31) — Em → Am, fades to drone

Total Runtime: 15:13

## Cohesion Elements:
- Recurring motif: Track 1 melody appears in Track 5
- Textural thread: Evolver patch used in Tracks 1, 3, 4
- Harmonic continuity: Low C drone in Tracks 2, 3, 5

## To Remember for Later:
- Track 2 dissolve ending needs reverb check
- Track 4 hook is strongest element
- Track 3 VSynth granular texture is the star

## Next Steps:
- Side A structure is locked ✓
- Begin Side B on Day 8
- Return for mixing/polish in Week 3 (optional)
```

---

## Success Criteria

By end of Day 7, you should have:

✓ **Final track order decided**  
✓ **5-6 tracks with one additional layer each**  
✓ **Small cohesion elements added**  
✓ **Rough mixes exported**  
✓ **Stems exported (optional)**  
✓ **Full Side A assembly rendered**  
✓ **Notes documented**

**Side A is now structurally complete.**

---

## What "Structurally Complete" Means

- All tracks exist as sketches
- Running order is locked
- Basic arrangement is done
- Cohesion elements are in place
- Everything is exported/backed up

**What it does NOT mean:**
- Final mixing
- Mastering
- Perfect sound design
- Polished production

**That comes later** (or never, if these sketches are your final artistic statement).

---

## Mindset Check

After 7 days of creative sprint, you might feel:
- Tired (good — you've done a lot)
- Uncertain about quality (normal — these are sketches)
- Excited about Side B (perfect timing)

**Remember:** Bowie's "Low" was recorded in weeks, not months. The Berlin Trilogy has rough edges, and that's part of its charm. Your Side A doesn't need to be perfect — it needs to be **authentic and complete**.

---

## Tomorrow: Week 2 Begins

Day 8 starts Side B — the ambient suite. Different mindset, different pace, different aesthetic.

**Rest tonight.** You've just written half an album.
