# Day 03 — Song Sketch 2

**Track:** Track 2 — "Shadow Pop"  
**Duration:** 3-4 min  
**Time Budget:** 1 hour creative session

---

## Track Brief

### Harmonic Plan
- **Key:** C minor → Eb major → Gm → F
- **Source progression:** Cm → Eb → Gm → F
- **Vibe:** Mood lift/shift after the bold opening. Darker colour, more rhythmic
- **Why:** Creates contrast with Track 1's brightness while maintaining Low-era moodiness

### Creative Approach
- Same workflow as Day 02
- 10 min: choose tempo + motif
- 40 min: record drum loop, bass idea, top-line, synth part
- 10 min: bounce, no perfection

---

## Elements

**Nord Lead 2X:**
- Simple riff (5-note repeating figure)
- More rhythmic than melodic
- Think "Breaking Glass" energy

**Prophet 12 Chords:**
- Darker, moodier pad setting
- Let chords sustain and overlap
- Cm → Eb creates the main tension/release

**Moog Bass:**
- Slightly more driving than Track 1
- Can be more present in the mix
- Follow roots but add rhythmic push

**Drum Machine:**
- Loose drum machine beat
- More prominent than Track 1
- Consider using the Volca noisy hat for this one

**Texture:**
- Let the last 20 seconds fall apart into ambience
- Use Evolver or VSynth XT for decay/dissolve

## Process Guidelines

### Today's Focus: Start with RHYTHM first

Unlike Day 02 (which may have started with chords), today build from rhythm up:

1. **Program drums** — make this groovier than Track 1
2. **Add bass** — lock it to the kick pattern
3. **Simple riff on Nord** — 5 notes, repeating with slight variation
4. **Add chords** for harmonic color (don't overplay)
5. **One texture layer** in the background
6. **Special ending:** last 20 seconds should dissolve

### Rhythm Before Harmony

This keeps each day's approach fresh and prevents formula.

## Structure Suggestion

```
0:00 - 0:15   Drums + bass (establish groove)
0:15 - 0:45   Add Nord riff (5-note repeating)
0:45 - 1:30   Chords enter (Cm → Eb → Gm → F)
1:30 - 2:30   Full arrangement (all elements)
2:30 - 3:00   Start to strip back
3:00 - 3:20   Dissolve: drums fade, texture swells
3:20 - 3:40   Ambient decay (reverb tails, texture only)
```

## Motif Generator

**5-Note Riff Ideas (pick one):**

1. **C - Eb - F - G - F** (minor pentatonic descent)
2. **G - F - Eb - D - C** (stepwise fall from 5th)
3. **C - D - Eb - G - C** (arc shape)
4. **Eb - F - G - Bb - G** (emphasize the relative major)

**Rhythmic Pattern:**
- Repeating dotted 8th pattern OR
- Straight 8ths but with one random accent
- Play it staccato (short, punchy)

---

## Key Difference from Track 1

**Track 1** was angular and unexpected (A Mixolydian).  
**Track 2** should feel darker and more groove-oriented.

Make this feel like the album is settling into a mood — still weird, still Bowie-esque, but with more rhythmic drive.

## The Dissolve Ending

This is your first experiment with texture + ambience. Here's how:

1. At 3:00 mark, automate drum volume down gradually
2. Keep bass playing but filter it darker (close the low-pass)
3. Let chords fade naturally
4. Bring up one texture sound (Evolver/VSynth)
5. Add reverb automation — increase send on the texture
6. Last 5-10 seconds: only reverb tails and texture
7. Hard stop OR fade to silence

This creates a sonic bridge hint toward Side B without fully committing yet.

---

## Oblique Strategy for Today

1. **Replace rhythm with texture** (try for the ending)
2. **Mute the bass for the first half** (radical variation)
3. **Delete your favourite part**
4. **Only use sounds from Side B for a Side A track**

## Export Checklist

- [ ] Bounce rough mix: `A02_Shadow_Pop_2025-12-XX.wav`
- [ ] Optional: Export stems
- [ ] Save project: `Track02_Shadow_Pop.als`
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Write 1-2 sentence note
- [ ] **Stop working** — the dissolve doesn't need to be perfect

---

## Daily Checklist

- [ ] Pick tempo (try 90-105 BPM for moodier feel)
- [ ] Start with DRUMS first today
- [ ] Add bass locked to kick
- [ ] Create 5-note riff (Nord Lead)
- [ ] Build chord progression (Prophet 12)
- [ ] Add one texture layer
- [ ] Create dissolve ending (last 20 seconds)
- [ ] Bounce rough mix
- [ ] Label clearly
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Stop — no perfection

## Remember

**Alternate approach keeps things fresh:**
- Day 2: Started with harmony/chords
- Day 3: Start with rhythm/groove

This prevents every track from feeling the same.

**Rule:** No revisiting yesterday's track. That kills momentum.
