# Day 06.5 — Song Sketch 6

**Track:** Track 6 — "Return Pulse"  
**Duration:** ~3 min  
**Time Budget:** 1 hour creative session

---

## Track Brief

### Harmonic Plan
- **Key:** C# minor with modal shifts
- **Source progression:** C#m → C# → E → G#m → C#m → Amaj7
- **Vibe:** Driving, hypnotic, parallel major/minor tension, Side A closer
- **Why:** Final energetic statement before Side B; the parallel C#m → C# shift echoes Track 4's "dislocation" concept

**Alternative progression (if the first doesn't inspire):**
- F#m → Bm → Dm → A → D → E (more chromatic, through-composed)

### Creative Approach
- This is your final Side A sketch — make it count
- Should feel like a confident ending or a launching point
- More rhythmic and propulsive than Track 5's calm resolution
- The C#m → C# parallel shift is your signature move

---

## Elements

**Nord Lead 2X:**
- **Rhythmic sequence or arpeggio** — driving, hypnotic
- Use the parallel minor/major shift (C#m → C#) as a feature
- Bright, present, cutting through

**Prophet 12:**
- **Sustained chords** OR **slow pad evolution**
- Support the Nord's rhythm
- Emphasize the Amaj7 resolution at the end of the progression

**Moog Bass:**
- **Pulsing eighth notes or syncopated pattern**
- Root movement: C# → C# → E → G# → C# → A
- Can stay minimal or add rhythmic interest

**Evolver OR FS1R (pick one):**
- **Textural layer** for the second half
- Evolver: feedback/modulated bleeps
- FS1R: formant shimmer or metallic texture

**Drums:**
- **Consistent, driving**
- More prominent than Track 5
- Think "minimal but propulsive" — Neu!/Bowie pulse

## Process Guidelines

### Today's Focus: Momentum and Closure

This is your sixth and final Side A sketch. It should feel like:
- A statement of confidence
- An energetic counterpoint to Track 5's calm
- A satisfying end to the song-based side

**The Parallel Shift:**
- C#m → C# is your harmonic signature
- This echoes Track 4's Dm → D move
- Use it to create tension and release

**The Return:**
- The progression cycles back to C#m
- The Amaj7 at the end creates an "opening" feeling
- This can transition naturally to Side B's ambient suite

## Structure Suggestion

```
0:00 - 0:15   Drums + Bass establish pulse (C#m)
              - Hypnotic, immediate energy

0:15 - 0:50   Add Nord sequence (C#m → C# → E)
              - The parallel shift should be obvious
              - Let it loop to establish pattern

0:50 - 1:30   Full progression (C#m → C# → E → G#m → C#m → Amaj7)
              - Prophet chords enter
              - 2-3 loops of the full progression

1:30 - 2:10   Add texture layer (Evolver or FS1R)
              - Builds intensity
              - Optional: slight tempo or filter automation

2:10 - 2:45   Strip back to core elements
              - Drums + Bass + Nord sequence
              - Focus on the C#m → C# shift

2:45 - 3:00   Ending options:
              - Hold Amaj7 and fade
              - Abrupt stop on C#m
              - Brief silence before Side B (if sequencing)
```

## The Parallel Minor/Major Shift

**This is your defining harmonic feature:**

**C#m (C# - E - G#)** → **C# major (C# - E#/F - G#)**

- Only one note changes: E becomes E#/F (a half-step up)
- Creates immediate brightness shift
- Very Bowie/Eno aesthetic
- Echoes "Dislocation" (Track 4)

**How to emphasize it:**
1. Let the Nord sequence highlight the shift
2. Have the bass stay on C# through both chords
3. The Prophet can voice the full chord changes
4. Make it rhythmically consistent so the shift is clear

---

## The Role of Track 6

**After five tracks, you need:**
- ✓ Energy (after Track 5's calm)
- ✓ Rhythmic drive (hypnotic pulse)
- ✓ Harmonic interest (parallel shifts)
- ✓ Sense of closure (returns to C#m, opens with Amaj7)

**Side A Arc with Track 6:**
1. Track 1: Angular opening
2. Track 2: Dark groove
3. Track 3: Experimental collage
4. Track 4: Catchy single
5. Track 5: Calm resolution
6. **Track 6: Confident closer / bridge to Side B** ✓

---

## Tempo Suggestion

**112-120 BPM** — faster and more driving than Tracks 4-5.

This creates propulsive energy and distinguishes it from the "calm" of Track 5.

## Sequence/Arpeggio Ideas (for Nord Lead)

Pick one approach for your main rhythmic element:

**Option 1: Ascending Triad Pattern**
- C# - E - G# - C# (up the octave)
- Shift to C# - F - G# - C# (major version)
- Sixteenth notes, steady pulse

**Option 2: Syncopated Root-Fifth Pattern**
- C# - G# - C# - G# (eighth notes, syncopated)
- When C# major arrives: C# - G# - F - G#
- Creates rhythmic drive

**Option 3: Broken Chord Pattern**
- C#m: C# - G# - E - G# - C# - E
- C#: C# - G# - F - G# - C# - F
- Continuous sixteenth notes

---

## The Amaj7 Resolution

**Why end on Amaj7:**
- A major is the relative major of F# minor
- A is a fifth below E (which appears in the progression)
- The maj7 (G#) creates an "unresolved" feeling
- **Perfect for transitioning to Side B's C# Dorian (Movement I)**

This creates a harmonic bridge between sides.

---

## Oblique Strategy for Today

Track 6 strategies:

1. **Rhythm first, harmony second** (program the pulse, then add chords)
2. **Commit to exactly 3 loops of the progression, no more**
3. **Use only sounds you've already used on other tracks** (cohesion)
4. **Work standing up** (physical energy = musical energy)

## Export Checklist

- [ ] Bounce rough mix: `A06_Return_Pulse_2025-12-XX.wav`
- [ ] Optional: Export stems (you'll have 6 tracks to balance on Lock-In day)
- [ ] Save project: `Track06_Return_Pulse.als`
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] Write note: Does the C#m → C# shift work? Does it close Side A?
- [ ] **Stop** — you now have 6 Side A sketches. Day 07 is Lock-In day.

---

## Daily Checklist

- [ ] Pick tempo (112-120 BPM suggested)
- [ ] Program drums + bass pulse (hypnotic, driving)
- [ ] Create Nord sequence/arpeggio (emphasize C#m → C# shift)
- [ ] Add Prophet chords (full progression)
- [ ] Add texture layer in second half (Evolver or FS1R)
- [ ] Structure with build and release
- [ ] Bounce rough mix (~3 min)
- [ ] Label clearly
- [ ] Back up
- [ ] **Stop** — Side A is now complete

---

## Remember

**You now have 6 Side A tracks:**
- Track 1: Opening Fragment (angular)
- Track 2: Shadow Pop (dark groove)
- Track 3: Blue Glass (collage)
- Track 4: Dislocation (catchy)
- Track 5: Small Resolution (calm)
- Track 6: Return Pulse (driving closer) ✓

**Tomorrow (Day 07) is Side A Lock-In:**
- Listen to all 6 tracks
- Choose final running order (probably 5-6 tracks)
- Make any quick edits
- Export Side A as a complete sequence

**Track 6 gives you options:**
- Include it as the closer (6-track Side A)
- Or use Track 5 as closer and save Track 6 for later
- Either way, you have material to work with
